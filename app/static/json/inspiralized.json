In this photo, I want to point out what matters most: finding your healthiest and happiest self. I\u2019m not talking about the 30 pound weight loss, I\u2019m talking about taking control of your own destiny and committing to being happy. And healthy. While I\u2019ve always had a sunny disposition, I had never truly found happiness with my health and body. Since I was about 18 or 19, I was always yo-yo dieting, fad-dieting, and just... dieting. In the before photo (on the left), I was about 170 pounds and miserable. I didn\u2019t know how to dress my body, all I wanted to do was cover it up. I didn\u2019t have my own style, because I didn\u2019t feel comfortable wearing trends. I didn\u2019t even feel comfortable walking into the trendy stores, I was terribly insecure. Most importantly, I didn\u2019t physically feel good, I was always tired and uncomfortable. I\u2019d wake up with food comas 5 out of 7 days of the week and was living a very unhealthy, unbalanced lifestyle. Fast forward to the present (literally, this photo on the right was taken yesterday) and my life has changed dramatically. Not only have I reached my healthiest and happiest self, I\u2019ve found my own personal style and I can finally have fun with the trends (like off the shoulder tops and high-waisted denim.) Confidence is the sexiest accessory, of course, but it comes with being happy with yourself, inside and out. Every day I wake up, I feel like I\u2019m helping others find their healthy stride, and I\u2019m nourishing my mind, body, and soul. I started @alissandrab mainly to catalogue this new chapter in my life, and I hope you all follow along and hopefully, it\u2019ll inspire those of you who are on a similar journey. And don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s a never-ending journey, but now, for the first time in my life, I\u2019m looking forward to the journey, bumps in the road and all.

After speaking on a panel with two other female entrepreneurs this weekend at @wfuniversity, I realized that one of my best qualities as an entrepreneur is that I\u2019m NOT a perfectionist. I don\u2019t strive for perfection, and I never have! I strive for progress and just to be the best I can personally be. I don\u2019t compare myself to others ever, because we\u2019re all so unique, there\u2019s room in this world for ALL of us to shine - and I\u2019m constantly inspired by the drive and success of those around me! \u2728SO. For those of you scared to press \u201cpublish\u201d on your first blog post or launch your business because it\u2019s not \u201cperfect\u201d yet, know this: you have to put something out there if you want to start. You\u2019ll grow from the feedback. This can even apply to something as basic as a healthy diet. Don\u2019t get discouraged just because you feel bloated and far from your goals. You just have to start! Erase perfection as an option and just strive to be better everyday. Get that project done, meet that incremental weight loss goal, because DONE is better than PERFECT, and that\u2019s what\u2019s going to get you closer to your happy place. The journey and the struggle is the everyday, so you need to make sure you\u2019re enjoying it!

DO your best, BE your best, and enjoy the stumbles in life (or in this case, the kitchen!) Embrace being a work in progress - that\u2019s half the fun!

It will be the first year that my body isn't something I wish would change. As I was making a post about my \"New Year's resolutions\", I realized this and went through old photos to think back on each year and where I was at certain stages with my body. I came upon a photo of Lu and I at a wedding (pre marriage), where I specifically remember being in a beautiful place with wonderful friends with my amazing (now) husband and all I could think about was if I should have another canap\u00e9 or not. Should I have another forkful of dessert. I was in constant mental battle with myself and the food I was eating and it's just such an empowering and liberating feeling to be at peace with (and proud of!) your body. The picture on the right was taken at our friends' wedding in Anguilla in November and there was no internal battles with food, all I thought about was the gorgeous wedding and the love in the air. I'll be sharing my 2017 resolutions on the blog in a couple of weeks and I just want everyone to know who wants to \"get there\" and be happy with their body is that what works is committing to a lifestyle, not a diet or 30 day plan. It's about saying to yourself, \"This is the first day of the new me!\" instead of \"This is the first day of my diet.\" \ud83d\udc95 ", "comments": 25}, {"date": "2016-09-04T16:01:18.000Z", "likes": 1116, "tags": ["#ritzcarlton", "#doradobeach", "#puertorico", "#dorado", "#vacation", "#labordayweekend", "#beach"], "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/bbffe5ad8900fb6e2a01c5c6c5b4704c/5B6393F5/t51.2885-15/e35/14099747_320023118340162_394473620_n.jpg", "description": "If only I could run @inspiralized from this pool chaise. \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb Hope everyone is having a relaxing, fun Labor Day weekend!

When this happens, I take 5 minutes to myself, put on some upbeat music (I\u2019m loving the new Biebs song), and make a list of the Top 3 things that I MUST accomplish that day - no ifs, ands, or buts. Usually, \u201cexercise\u201d makes the list, but also work-related tasks. After visiting my grandfather in the hospital last night (thanks for all your kind words through Snapchat last night - it meant a lot), and seeing how he\u2019s beating cancer in his mid 80s, I realized that positivity and a determined mindset is all you need. His will to live and his optimism despite such unfortunate circumstances keeps him fighting and keeps the cancer at bay. SO, long story short (this was my 5 minutes with the new Biebs song on, can you tell??), take a minute (or 5) to yourself, set your intentions (again) and resolve to power through this day and make it yours. \ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc ", "comments": 23}, {"date": "2017-06-23T00:47:59.000Z", "likes": 1750, "tags": ["#dinner", "#vegan", "#glutenfree", "#vegetarian", "#cleaneating", "#healthy", "#avocado", "#sweetpotato", "#kale"], "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/40e110387cf6e3a6d35b2cc02d2861c1/5B79EE65/t51.2885-15/e35/19367151_1585150578225477_975905814776643584_n.jpg", "description": "Leaving tomorrow to fly down to Florida for my live @hsn taping on Saturday, so I threw all of my veggies onto sheet pans, saut\u00e9ed the last of my kale, and topped it all with avocado!

As I walked to the 9/11 memorial in Jersey City today (I live on the Hudson River directly across from where the WTCs used to stand), I felt courage and strength. With all the hurricane devastation, there's been a lot of unknown and fear, but what I've noticed is that it brings everyone together, like 9/11 did - it's inspiring to see people care for complete strangers and send prayers and acknowledge the fear and pain they are going through. All of you have been so amazing to reach out to me about my parents and brother who now live in Florida (they're OK by the way, thank you!) and today when I walked out my door and saw this, I felt the pride and hope of this country - and that we can get through anything.

Many nutrients are in the skin of the zucchini and it makes for a beautiful green presentation. Plus, the firm skin holds up against heavy sauces and keeps some of that moisture tucked away (once you peel it, the inside flesh will start to \"sweat\" and you'll end up with a soupier-than-normal bowl of noodles.)

Since I was off my game last week on account of my Bell\u2019s Palsy recovery, I forgot Tip Tuesday! This week, let's talk about spiralizing BROCCOLI. \ud83e\udd66\ud83e\udd66\ud83e\udd66 Yes, you can spiralize broccoli! And I recommend it - it has a similar consistency to a carrot noodle once it's boiled and there are so many great vitamins in the stems! Here are a few tips for you and if all else fails, click the link in our profile for more information (and a video \ud83c\udfa5) on how to spiralize broccoli stems!\n//\n\ud83d\udccc Save up your broccoli stems (they last up to 1 week in the refrigerator for best results!) as you use broccoli florets - never throw them away! At the end of the week, spiralize the stems and use them in a meal or save them in the freezer for future use!\n\ud83d\udccc Search for THICK broccoli stems - at least 1.5\" in diameter, but the bigger the better \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude1d\n\ud83d\udccc Before you spiralize, slice off any knobs off the sides of the broccoli so you don't get shreds and instead, even noodles!\n\ud83d\udccc Always use Blade D - Blade D on @theinspiralizer yields the thinnest, spaghetti-like noodles. Any other blade won't be as effective, because broccoli stems aren't thick enough to use other sized blades!\n\ud83d\udccc Embrace the wonky noodles - spiralizing broccoli isn't like a zucchini - broccoli bits will break off, pieces will be uneven, but at the end, you get a combo of broccoli slaw and noodles - and once they're cooked up, they're delicious, so don't strive for perfect noodles! //\nThose are my tips - so tell me, have you spiralized broccoli yet?

Don\u2019t be afraid of the time it may take you to accomplish your goals/dreams. As Earl Nightingale says, the time\u2019s going to pass anyway! What helps me in staying on track with my goals (both personal and professional) is to think about that gap of time. How do I want to spend that gap of time? NOT working towards a goal or working towards it? Sure, it may take me 5, 10, 15 years to achieve my dreams for Inspiralized, but what\u2019s the alternative? Giving up, just because that length of time intimidates me? No way! The same applies for health and fitness - it may take you 3 months to lose those extra pounds, define a muscle group, or train for that race, but if you don\u2019t give up and keep on track, those 3 months will be here in no time (and, yes, that time is going to pass anyway!) See where I\u2019m taking this? Embrace the journey, or as @robinnyc would say, MARINATE in it. The hustle is the most rewarding part of all!

They frequently ask, \u201cWhat did you eat to lose weight?\u201d (PS: if you didn\u2019t already know, I lost 30 pounds about a year ago and have since kept it off, +/- 5 pounds) It\u2019s so tough to answer this question adequately. I didn\u2019t set out to \u201close 30 pounds\u201d, I decided once and for all that I\u2019d commit to a healthy lifestyle forever. That means no more calorie counting, no more compulsive exercising (i.e. 2 a days) and no more feeling shameful or guilty over food. I started simply eating clean, wholesome, REAL foods. That\u2019s it! No more \"cheat days\", just days where I eat something \"unhealthy\" because a) I love food and b) it brings me happiness. Now, whenever I have a weekend where I over-indulge (MDW was full of \ud83c\udf55, \ud83c\udf78and \ud83c\udf6a), I don\u2019t \u201cdetox\u201d or do anything crazy like that.

I had to teach myself to cook right away and the first dish I truly learned to make that senior year was a tofu and veggie teriyaki stir fry over brown rice. I must've made it 100 times (and @cass6127 my roommate and college bestie can confirm that.) Now, I'm no longer vegan, but I still incorporate vegan principles into my cooking, with slight modifications to fit my current lifestyle. Tonight, I scrambled in eggs to turn the brown rice into a fried rice for extra protein and flavor. Still to this day, I love this dish and am so thankful for my two years as a vegan.

Another week, I forgot to post my Tuesday tip, so it's Tip Friday! FRIYAY, guys. FRIYAY. Today we're talking about HOW TO AVOID SOGGY NOODLES. Now, this really is only an issue with zucchini noodles (because they're made up of over 90% water.) While excess moisture is inevitable, you shouldn't be left with soggy noodles every time you cook your zucchini! Here are a few tips on how to avoid a bowl of soupy zoodles and for more info, click the link in our profile for a video on the topic!\n//\n\u2795 After you spiralize the zucchini, moisture comes out because the skin is removed (@theinspiralizer peels as it spiralizes!), so pat your noodles dry after spiralizing to get rid of some moisture.\n\u2795 If you're making a sauce, make sure to reduce it fully - watery sauces will turn into really watery sauces, once the zucchini cooks and releases that extra moisture.\n\u2795 Keep the skin on your zucchini - not only does the skin contain essential nutrients, it gives the noodle that needed crunch, helping to avoid a soggy texture.\n\u2795 You can definitely salt your zucchini and wait for the moisture to drip off OR squeeze your zoodles in a cheesecloth to rid of excess moisture BUT this will leave you with soggy noodles (once the moisture leaves the zucchini, they're limp noodles!) I don't recommend this method, it's time consuming and doesn't get you very far.\n\u2795 Add moisture-wicking ingredients, like cheese, meats, breadcrumbs, and other veggies that are not high in moisture.\n\u2795 Don't add your noodles into a sauce - always cook the sauce and then top your noodles with the sauce.\n\u2795 Never dump your cooked noodles into a bowl - remove them with pasta tongs, letting any water drip out before you place them in your serving bowl.\n\u2795 After you cook your noodles, drain them into a colander and pat dry before serving. \u2795 Eat immediately! The longer the noodles sit in the sauce, the more time the noodles have for their moisture to release. So, eat up!\n//\nThose are this week's tips!

I don\u2019t know if this baby is having a last-minute growth spurt or something, but last night I couldn\u2019t stop eating! I don\u2019t share enough about the days when I don\u2019t eat my healthiest, so I figured I\u2019d share! And yes, I\u2019m pregnant, but being pregnant doesn\u2019t mean you can just eat whatever and however much you like - quite the contrary, it\u2019s even more important to eat well to nourish that baby inside you! \ud83d\udc76\ud83c\udffb And things like sugar affect the baby just like they affect us! Anyway, I literally ate a box of @simplemills chocolate chip cookies \ud83c\udf6a\ud83c\udf6a (they\u2019re dangerously good!), a bag of @squareorganics new protein sea salt popcorn (also insanely good - it almost tastes cheesy, it\u2019s addictive!), globs of almond butter and dates, two mugs of @naturespathorganic cereal with almond milk, a couple of @lundbergarms rice cakes, and an @alohamoment protein bar.

There\u2019s always a reason behind eating like this, and for me, it was hydration - I was out for most of the day and didn\u2019t drink much water, so my body was dehydrated. \ud83d\udca6 Instead of filling up my big water bottle like I always do at night, I started munching - and once the munching begins, it\u2019s hard to stop!

It wasn\u2019t until the past couple of years with @inspiralized and being on social media did I realize that she had such a profound impact on how I go about my life. I don\u2019t compare myself with others, I\u2019m happy for the success of those around me, and I\u2019m not discouraged, only motivated and inspired by those who are doing big things. They\u2019re not \u201cbetter\u201d things, they\u2019re just \u201cbig\u201d things. If you find yourself saying things like, \u201cI\u2019ll never be as [insert jealous adjective here] as her!\u201d or \u201cI wish my business was as successful as theirs!\u201d, stop yourself and just realize that, especially on social media, people tend to promote only the highlights and the good, not the struggle or the hardships.

I feel like I\u2019m never doing enough or that my company isn\u2019t where it needs to be. I often think I\u2019m being lazy or not achieving my potential. Life is real, and the struggle is real. Keep your chin up, put one foot in front of the other, and keep pushing forward, because at the end of the day, that\u2019s all you CAN do. And it\u2019ll pay off in the end. And as for comparing yourself to others: just don\u2019t do it. Remember: there\u2019s NO ONE in this world who can be you. You\u2019re you - and THAT\u2019S what makes you special. So be you.

January 1st is a time when the majority of us set health goals - weight loss, muscle-building, etc. What most people do leading up to the New Year is \u201cget it all in\u201d before their diets start. It\u2019s more shocking and thus, less sustainable if you look at it that way. Instead of waiting until the New Year to start working towards your healthiest self, why not start on December 1st? It\u2019s the holiday season, so it\u2019s going to be tough - but make little choices each day that help you get closer to your goals, so that when January 1st comes around, you\u2019ll look back at today and thank yourself for starting the shift earlier. It\u2019s a hustle, after all - it\u2019s a hustle to keep healthy, especially around this time of year when the temptation comes in the shape of champagne, cocktail parties, Christmas cookies, and festive excuses. And it\u2019s okay, it IS a hustle - there will be ups and downs. But promise yourself today to not let yourself go for the next 31 days. You won\u2019t feel good during this joyful time of year if you\u2019re bloated, lethargic, and unhappy with yourself. Promise yourself that you\u2019re committing to a lifestyle- the calendar date doesn\u2019t mean anything.

My grandmother passed away on Tuesday late morning. She was my mother\u2019s mother and our neighbor growing up. She wasn\u2019t just that grandparent you see on holidays. She was the kind of grandma that taught me to read, that came over for saltines and tuna salad snacks after school, took me to the theater in NYC, and took me on trips to Europe, to see and experience the world. This past year has been very hard, as she developed dementia and hasn\u2019t been mentally with us for a while. While she may not have been aware recently, I always had her in my heart, especially when I walked down the aisle to marry my husband. Now, I know she\u2019s watching from wherever she is, proud of the woman I am. I haven\u2019t been as active on social media as I normally have (on Snapchat especially) because it feels uncomfortable to smile or laugh. I haven\u2019t put myself on camera, because it\u2019s hard to be my usual happy, bright self. I\u2019ve read all of your sweet notes on my last post on @alissandrab, as well as on Snapchat, and you have no idea how much it means to me. Today, Meaghan\u2019s here with me and we put up this frame on the wall in the office. Although I bought this print weeks ago, it now proves even more true: I\u2019ve cried, I worked out yesterday with my sister to try to shake the sadness, and tomorrow, I leave for Florida (with my sister) to spend time with my mom, by the sea. Time heals everything and in these times, you realize what\u2019s truly important. Thank you to everyone for your kindness in advance, and I appreciate your patience as I take a little time to get back into the swing of things. \u2764\ufe0f", "comments": 25}, {"date": "2016-11-07T15:00:56.000Z", "likes": 1024, "tags": ["#spiralizer", "#spiraliser", "#healthy", "#vegetarian", "#vegan", "#quinoa", "#glutenfree", "#veggies", "#cleaneating", "#buzzfeast"], "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/b071e5db3a80849c4932b0f019be2302/5B64870C/t51.2885-15/e35/14719592_199002893878114_7688540601473564672_n.jpg", "description": "NEW on the blog: Roasted Spiralized Vegetable and Quinoa Bowl.

In the past, I used to demand so much of myself: I\u2019m going to do a 1 hour intense workout every morning for a month or, \u201cI\u2019m going to not eat this or that for a week.\u201d More often than not, those plans failed and I was left feeling defeated and frustrated. Finally, I accepted that what\u2019s more impactful is all of the little steps forward you take - they ended up leading you closer to your end goals than the big pushes, because those usually end up thwarted by things like life. Plus, when life DOES get in the way, it\u2019s comforting to know that the littles still help - and they\u2019re more manageable. Focus on the littles, like eating healthy at one meal or running that extra 1 mile during a workout or saying no to dessert when out with friends. That all adds up to a lot \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffc Tag a friend who may need to see this too!

It\u2019s been quite the experience, and I\u2019m trying not to freak out or worry too much. I\u2019m seeing all the right doctors, getting bloodwork, trying acupuncture, drinking turmeric, and trying NOT to stress myself out, because apparently that\u2019s what caused this, along with other factors like hormones from pregnancy, etc. Even though cooking is \u201cwork\u201d most days, it\u2019s what makes me feel the most relaxed and happy, so I\u2019m doing that and trying not to stare at a computer for hours and accepting that I\u2019m not going to be productive for the next couple of weeks (which, ironically, stresses me out!) I guess I didn\u2019t realize what an overachiever I was until now. Someone is trying to tell me to slowwwwwwww down. I wanted to also hop on here and let you know that I started a separate Instagram account for my baby food journey, now that we\u2019ve started Luca on solid foods!

As I was looking through old YouTube videos, I stumbled upon one of the first ones I made of my sweet potato noodle buns, made in December 2013, just about 5 months after starting Inspiralized. It made me realize that while this little brand I\u2019m building has grown so much, so have I. Since this video, so much has happened - from becoming a NY Times bestselling author to getting married, I\u2019ve learned so much about myself, my priorities, my body, and the woman I want to be. I\u2019ve found my healthiest self and finally found peace with food and that has been the biggest accomplishment for me. I actually remember filming this original video (on the left) and wearing a baggy, dirty black sweater to hide my tummy because I had binge ate the night before and felt absolutely crappy and uncomfortable in my own skin. On the right, filmed just about a month ago, I was energized, happy, and fit. I think the most wonderful part about entrepreneurship isn\u2019t necessarily the growth of your business, but the growth of yourself.
