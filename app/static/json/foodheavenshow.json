Today we teamed up w/ @Quaker to bring you this insanely delish recipe for those mornings when you just want to stay home and chill. We made the waffles with @Quaker Old Fashioned Oats. Oats are a whole grain that supplies 4 grams of fiber per serving, plus thiamine, phosphorus, & magnesium. We use oats in so many of our recipes because aside from being convenient and affordable, they\u2019re also super versatile. Check out this recipe in bio link!

As the months get cooler, I prefer juices vs smoothies. I find them more comforting. One big beef many dietitians have w/ juices is that they're usually high in sugar, since it takes quite a bit of fruit to make a decent cup of juice. This is a valid concern if you're making fruit-based juices. The 3 tonics we made have a good balance of veg + fruit with each juice having no more than 2 servings of carbs. They also contain seasonal ingredients like ginger, which is particularly wonderful during these cooler months. Recipes on the site!
