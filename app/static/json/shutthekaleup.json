bodies after birth.\nwhile our bodies naturally produce its own collagen, as we age we produce less \ud83d\ude1f so i take my @vitalproteins collagen and @bulletproof bars to keep my hair on fleek,

Aj and I were both terrified, confused and everything in between. because I was 38 weeks, there was a sense of urgency to figure it out and come up with a different birth plan. we weren't sleeping well, our minds seemed cloudy and stress was kickin in \ud83d\ude44 honestly, we were just afraid since everything else had gone so smoothly. then yesterday happened.. we met with a specialist in natural breech births and became aware that it IS possible to still have a safe and natural birth if baby is positioned correctly for this procedure. so, we've decided to go with it. a home breech birth is what we're doing (lord willing). Elliott is in \"frank position\" and weighs about 6lbs 3oz which is ideal for this kind of birth. I'm no longer confused or afraid. lots of questions were answered. I CAN and WILL do this. I have faith everything will go as God had planned. I'm grateful for the resources we've had. I truly believe this scare was a test to see how we'd react on decision making and becoming parents.. I have to say Aj is an incredible papa already and a huge support. I couldn't do any of this without him.\nin the mean time, I'll be resting/nesting/eating all the food waiting for my birthing time.

I simply hate the word and the restrictions that come along with them. I suffered from an eating disorder for 2 1/2 years. I starved/binged/dieted like crazy. it sucked and I was miserable. I compared myself to every girl I saw. it was unhealthy. I didn't know how to get out of that head space and thought no one understood what I was going through. it was indeed a lonely place. with the help of Aj (my husband) and friends, I was able to find balance. what also helped was getting laid off from a job I hated for 7 years. I was able to have time off to relax and focus on what I was really interested in. YOGA, HEALTH, and WELL BEING. that's when it all started to change for me. I was able to see things more clearly and food was no longer an enemy. I'm not saying it's completely gone.. it's just no longer a struggle of mine and it NO longer defines who I am. I'm happy in my own skin. I don't care what people think of me nor do I compare myself to others. we're all different and I like to embrace that. I eat what I want, when I want. I do pay close attention to ingredients. realllll close \ud83d\udc40 and GMO's can suck it.
