It looks like Chyna will be racing with Nicki Minaj in a different way based on recent news that Blac Chyna is gunning for a music career and setting herself up to be the new Nicki Minaj. According to TMZ, \u201cseveral record labels\u201d are down to help her reach her goals; she\u2019s supposedly already met with Capitol Records and has other meetings lined up.\nSources close to Blac Chyna (who are, as always, to be trusted at your own peril) claim that she\u2019s already in the studio making music in the \u201crap, \u2018poetry music\u2019 and traditional singing\u201d genres. Nevertheless, Chyna has yet to be signed.\nThese new rumors come just a week after Blac Chyna starred alongside Minaj in Yo Gotti\u2019s new music video for \u201cRake it Up,\u201d which was filmed down in Miami. The pair was dressed in colorful, skin-tight latex and looked pretty happy to be spending time together\u2014or at least it seemed like it from the pictures.\nAccording to TMZ, Blac Chyna even counts Minaj as a mentor. Remember that Blac Chyna did work as Minaj\u2019s body double in Kanye West\u2019s \u201cMonster\u201d video, so she does have a standing relationship with Minaj.

His advice? \u201cCut off your black-ass afro.\u201d OK, he didn\u2019t use those exact words, but he did say that Kaepernick should cut his hair. \u201cThe first thing we got to get Colin to do is cut his hair,\u201d said Vick on FS1\u2019s Speak for Yourself on Monday. \u201cListen, I\u2019m not up here to try to be politically correct, but even if he puts cornrows in it, I don\u2019t think he should represent himself in that way in terms of just a hairstyle. Just go clean-cut. Why not? You\u2019re already dealing with a lot of controversy surrounding this issue. What he needs to do is just try to be presentable.\u201d I understand that this is one black quarterback telling another what he thinks is \u201cpresentable,\u201d but there is just so much wrong with this that I don\u2019t even know where to begin.\n\nVick, who was famously jailed for almost two years in 2007 for his involvement in a dogfighting ring, had cornrows himself in his last year with the Atlanta Falcons before he got shipped off to the pokey for 21 months. When he got out, he cut his hair and had a career with the Eagles and a few other teams for a few years, and ostensibly lived happily ever after. But Mike, let me bullet-point out what is all kinds of wrong with your statement.\n\nI say, if Kaepernick wants to let his kinky hair fly, so be it! Nobody asked all those guys with dreadlocks to cut their damn hair. Oh, I get it\u2014it\u2019s to make NFL owners and racist fans feel as if he\u2019s getting in line. It\u2019s fine when black football players are shooting themselves in the leg, making it rain in strip clubs or beating black women down\u2014but social justice, that\u2019s just a little too close to home for the 1 percent owners and the league\u2019s racist fans.

If you missed it, the likes of Drake, Lil Uzi, Nas, Kid Cudi, Travis and more have all been out there in the past weeks to help him.\n\nWe\u2019ll continue to keep you posted moving forward.

Offset, who has also been one of the rap\u2019s most sought-after featured artists in 2017, got down on bended knee and received the answer that any man wants to hear from their prospective spouse: hell yes! Now, in a new report from TMZ, some details about that engagement ring have come to light and let\u2019s just say that it took multiple bands in order to cop a ring good enough for Cardi.\n\nThere definitely wasn\u2019t any corner-cutting when it came time for Offset to plunk down some of his hard-earned dollars on the ring. Apparently it it ran him a little north of half a million bucks \u2013 $550,000 to be exact. The ring, which took over a month to make, was put together by Pristine Jewelers, an upscale New York City jeweler. Although the couple had a brief breakup that was very public on Instagram for a minute, the ring was made ready just in time for the proposal to go down in Philadelphia.\n\nIn total, Cardi\u2019s ring features an 8-carat stone, surrounded by 2 half-carat pear diamonds and 2 carats worth of pink and white gems. The overall design, which is in the shape of a raindrop, was custom designed as per explicit instructions from Offset himself. The ring was supposedly finished on the day of his Philly Powerhouse proposal, which means he picked up the item mere hours before going through with the engagement. Talk about perfect timing.\n\nAt the end of the day, Offset might be getting some of that money back, after BET expressed interest in turning the couple\u2019s nuptials into a made-for-TV event similar to Gucci Mane\u2019s wedding extravaganza that went down earlier this fall. There\u2019s no telling exactly when wedding bells will be ringing for Cardi B and Offset, but whenever it does happen, it\u2019s sure to be an unforgettable piece of television.

But it is imperative that we don\u2019t lose sight of the simple truth \u2013 these men were CONGRATULATED by a white supremacist culture for degrading black men and women, portraying us as disposable as a cockroach within their lyrics,\u201d Speech wrote in the caption.\n\nRaven-Symone reposted the photo with emojis that signified she agreed with Speech\u2019s assessment, which caught the ire of her Instagram users to the point she deleted the post. She then posted another image explaining why she did so but said she still stood in support of Speech\u2019s view of the artists. T.I. caught wind of her stance, and he fired off an Instagram post as well in response.\n\nThe reaction on Twitter to Raven-Symone sharing out Speech\u2019s post got the expected reaction.

One headline even reads: Move Over Iggy Azalea: Bhad Bhabie Is Coming for the White Girl Spot in the Rap Game.\n\nSpeaking on repetitive cultural appropriation comments she\u2019s received from hip-hop fans, Bregoli told the folks over at Fader in December, \u201cI look at that cultural appropriation shit and I just ignore it because it\u2019s ridiculous, it really is. You cannot act a color. Do not tell me I\u2019m acting black because I\u2019m not. I\u2019m acting \u2018urban,\u2019 or whatever you want to call it.

He says two out of the three elements of the song were taken from his. As Rackboy raps about his jewelry, car and women, he claims YFN took the jewelry and women aspect.\n\nNow, Rackboy wants a judge to remove the song from receiving any sort of radio play and to make sure that sales from the song stop.

However, it seems that his own team might be concerned for his well-being.\n\nThe folks over at TheBlast report that several people in Kanye\u2019s team are worried for his mental health after some of his erratic behavior. The rapper allegedly went on a rant inside the studio where he yelled at everyone inside of the room that he doesn\u2019t need people with \u201ctitles\u201d around. He also claimed that he\u2019s willing to handle his career on his own and keep the Yeezy brand handled in-house, which essentially means just him. He allegedly closed out the rant by yelling, \u201cYeezy is the new Apple.\u201d According to the report, his team are unsure of how to handle the outbursts.\n\nMany of the people on his team were there for him after his 2016 breakdown that led him to being hospitalized. They say that these people are also being pushed away.\n\nIn addition, the rapper\u2019s recent tweets were initially thought to be promo for his forthcoming album, however, that may not be the case. His inner circle reportedly believe much of this is a sign that he\u2019s leading into a darker place in his life.\n\nAs for Kim, she\u2019s said to have been incredibly supportive for Kanye and continues to hold him down.

With everything she\u2019s accomplished so far, fans and haters alike keep wondering what is next for the Bronx rapper, and if she can live up to the hype of and follow up \u201cBodak.\u201d Well, now we\u2019re going to find out because Cardi is back with her new single \u201cBartier Cardi\u201d and she brought 21 Savage along for the ride.\n\nCardi announced the single weeks ago, and though it didn\u2019t drop on her proposed date of December 15, it\u2019s here now, just a week later. There was some skepticism that Cardi could give \u201cBodak\u201d a proper followup, both in terms of hype and quality, as her other Top 10 hits were guest appearances on \u201cNo Limit\u201d with G-Eazy and \u201cMotorsport\u201d with Migos and Nicki Minaj. But Cardi more than held her own on both tracks, so some of that skepticism should have been quelled with her performances there.\n\nNow, after a huge year, Cardi is a bonafide star and hitmaker. For those who called her a one hit wonder, she has since released two other hits in her features, and based on the quality of \u201cBartier Cardi,\u2019 has another solo hit on her hands. For those who just couldn\u2019t seem to get over her Kodak Black homage in \u2018Bodak Yellow\u2019 she delivered a completely original track in \u2018Bartier Cardi\u2019 where she uniquely switched her flow MULTIPLE times. So there\u2019s little reason left to doubt her and her ability. Check out Cardi B\u2019s new single \u201cBartier Cardi\u201d featuring 21 Savage at www.itsKenBarbie.com.

Now, natural hair emoji are on the horizon and curl friends everywhere can\u2019t wait.\n\nWhile many are excited to see more diverse visuals emerge within technology, there are those who believe the look of these new tiny digital images are a little suspect.\n\nOn Dec. 5, BI Tech shared a photo of 28 new emoji with a caption that read, \u201cHere\u2019s your first look at all new emoji coming next year.\u201d The image attached to the tweet includes emoji with what appears to be natural curly hair and straight gray hair, as well as some with bald heads.\n\nSince its posting, the tweet has sparked lots of excitement and conversation with a long list of over 660 comments. Individuals delighted by the emoji with natural hair were inspired to leave messages such as \u201cYasssss for the natural hair emoji!!!! Black twitter would be in love lol\u201d\n\nAdding emoji with natural hair textures does reflect progress toward making everyone feel like they can personally identify with these characters. But a significant number of people questioned the actual design. One person asked, \u201cIs that supposed to be natural hair?\u201d Another responded with, \u201cMy hair does not look like that,\u201d and a flutter of others echoed the same feelings.\n\nTwo years ago, massive Unilever brand Dove launched the first ever Love Your Curls emoji keyboard, which included 27 curly hair designs, seven GIFS, and the capability to adjust the skin and hair color. Many women with natural hair textures were equally enthused about these emoji and hoped that the idea would be replicated on a larger scale.\n\nWell, it looks like their vision is finally becoming a reality, and though it\u2019s sparked a slight bit of controversy, I believe it is definitely a step in the right direction.

She says as much in a new interview with TMZ, though she\u2019s probably at least half-joking. \u201cI demand sex every day from my boyfriend, absolutely,\u201d she tells the outlet as she\u2019s getting into her car. \u201cIt\u2019s very healthy,\u201d she continues. The reporter continues to ask about Amber and 21\u2019s sex habits as she talks on the phone with Blac Chyna. Amber then reveals that the Atlanta rapper\u2019s birthday is just the day after her\u2019s, which was this past Saturday (Oct. 21). At this point, Amber and 21 are easily one of pop culture\u2019s biggest infatuations of the moment, and it\u2019s easy to see why. Though being a lover and a fighter were never mutually exclusive things, people probably never imagined that the hardcore East Atlanta rapper would venture into the lovey-dovey spaces he has over the last several months. Speaking on Amber this past Spring, the East Atlanta rapper let it be known that no disrespect toward Amber would be tolerated. \u201cWe just been kicking it, man. She\u2019s a real cool woman. She treat me like a king, so it is what it is,\u201d Savage explained at the time. \u201cAnd no disrespect will be tolerated at all. Keep your mouth closed, no hoes, no bitches, no nothing. Because I\u2019m pulling up on God.\u201d Since then, 21 has popped up to support Amber\u2019s annual Slut Walk and serenaded her with love songs. This past weekend, he once again put his vocals to the test as he crooned to Amber at Rolling Loud in the Bay Area.\n\nWatch Amber joke about demanding sex from 21 in the short clip at www.itsKenBarbie.com "}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/1142373645e3683f439fb2d146ff6d95/5B65EE2C/t51.2885-15/e35/26187603_325188384649285_7873453688189091840_n.jpg", "tags": ["#offset", "#offsetryn", "#migos", "#themigos", "#cardi", "#cardib", "#bardi", "#bardib", "#bardigang", "#bartiercardi", "#bodakyellow", "#moneymoves", "#bloodyshoes", "#entertainment", "#entertainmentnews", "#entertainmentblog", "#gossip", "#gossipblog", "#gossipblogger", "#celebrities", "#celebrityblogger", "#kenbarbie", "#itskenbarbie", "#thisisyourbrainondrugs"], "comments": 12, "likes": 626, "date": "2018-01-05T04:57:52.000Z", "description": "Here we go again, the internet has convinced itself that Offset may be cheating on Cardi B.

Queen Bey formerly held this record in May of 2016 when her album Lemonade debuted with 12 songs on the Hot 100. Unsurprisingly, Drake holds the record for most simultaneously charting Hot 100 entries over all with an impressive 24 tracks charting.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 boasted 12 tracks on the Hot 100 dated May 14, 2016, the week that her album Lemonade launched at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 (with all the set\u2019s songs on the Hot 100 that week). Here is a look at Cardi B\u2019s 13 songs on the Hot 100 dated April 21:\n\nNo. 8, \u201cI Like It\u201d (Cardi B, Bad Bunny & J Balvin) (debut)\nNo. 10, \u201cFinesse\u201d (Bruno Mars & Cardi B)\nNo. 11, \u201cBe Careful\u201d\nNo. 21, \u201cDrip\u201d (feat.

Ryan provided the police with a video of Naya\u2019s attack which led authorities to take her into custody. Naya was released on $1,000 bail and her father-in-law picked her up from prison the next day since she was in Virginia spending Thanksgiving with her in-laws. \u201c[Dorsey] says his wife, Naya, had struck him in the head and the bottom lip while the two were taking their child for a walk down the street,\u201d Jatara McGee and Markie Owens of WSAZ reported.\n\nIn a new audio recording that has surfaced via TMZ, we can hear the call Ryan made to police when Naya was attacking him. Ryan is heard saying he needs the help of authorities because his \u201cwife\u2019s out of control.\u201d Ryan explains to the responder that Naya is \u201cgetting physical\u201d adding that his father is there with them, but she\u2019s not getting violent with him. Listen to the audio in the full story.\n\nThe call then drops for an unknown reason before the operator can get any more information.\n\nWhen the story first made headlines, Naya\u2019s ex-boyfriend Big Sean made a tweet that was seemingly related to the whole matter. The video tweeted by Sean sees a little girl telling the camera, \u201cI told ya\u2019ll n***as, ya\u2019ll thought I was playin\u2019 but I told ya\u2019ll n***as.\u201d The tweet was just too soon after the matter for us to not think it was a direct response to Naya\u2019s physical actions.\n\nThe duo broke-up just three months before Naya and Ryan walked down the aisle and got married. After the fact, Big Sean released one of his biggest singles to date, \u201cIDFWU\u201d that many believed was about Naya.

It\u2019s definitely going to be a solid episode and we can only expect her to perform atleast one of her new singles. This will mark her fifth appearance as a performer on the show. She\u2019s performed by herself in 2011 and 2015 while showing up during Drake and The Weeknd\u2019s set as well.\n\nAt this point, it\u2019s safe to believe that she\u2019ll be rolling out her album in the near future. If this is anything like Cardi B\u2019s role out with Invasion Of Privacy, it seems likely that she\u2019ll end up releasing the project right before her appearance on SNL. Will you be tuning in?

There are hedges which surround the gated property, as well as a courtyard with a garden of succulents and a four-car garage.\n\nThe white interiors include a kitchen with Caeserstone countertops, four en suite bedrooms, including a guest house with an adjoining bathroom and kitchenette. Furthermore, both the guest house and main residence overlook the lounge, pool area and cabana. The house is also located near a bevy of retail spots, restaurants and cafes, if you ever feel like leaving this palace.\n\nVariety reports Rihanna never actually moved into the mansion, probably because of the more expensive residence in the Hollywood Hills she also purchased recently.

The performance featured several surprises, including a special appearance from Jay Z and a Destiny\u2019s Child reunion.\n\nNow, before the pitchforks come out, this isn\u2019t Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s fault or even something specifically affecting her. According to Billboard, the live-streaming deal only applied for the first week of shows, meaning that no sets from the upcoming second week of Coachella will be streamed either. Fans of The Weeknd or Cardi B have an equal right to get upset about this news.\n\nEven worse for Beyonc\u00e9 fans, however, is that the second show was planned to be different than the first. One of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s numerous back-up dancers, Jo\u2019Artis Mijo Ratti, confirmed with Variety that changes were being planned for the upcoming performance. \u201cYeah, we\u2019re switching up a couple things, so there could still be a wow factor,\u201d said Ratti.\n\nIf there\u2019s any good in this world, an enterprising Beyonc\u00e9 fan will be willing to live stream the performance themselves for the entire Beyhive to watch. Those of us who will not be attending Coachella Weekend 2 will simply have to settle for re-watching her first performance until we\u2019re satisfied.

According to TMZ, Rivera supposedly struck her husband, Ryan Dorsey, multiple times while they were walking with their 2-year-old son.\n\nThe Kanawha County Sheriff\u2019s Department deputies were given a video of the attack by Dorsey, which led to Rivera getting taken into custody around 9:30 PM Eastern Time Saturday. She then appeared before a judge early Sunday morning and was subsequently released on $1,000 bond. Interestingly, it was her father-in-law who reportedly picked her up from the prison. Both Rivera and Dorsey were in West Virginia to spend Thanksgiving weekend with his family. \u201c[Dorsey] says his wife, Naya, had struck him in the head and the bottom lip while the two were taking their child for a walk down the street,\u201d reported Jatara McGee and Markie Owens of WSAZ, a local NBC affiliate that broke the story late yesterday. The couple have been married since 2014, with nuptials that came under quite a bit of scrutiny from the hip-hop world.\n\nRivera infamously walked down the aisle with Dorsey just three months after breaking off her engagement with Big Sean, the Detroit-area rapper who now counts Jhene Aiko as his romantic partner. Soon after that very public breakup and aftermath, Rivera was assumed to be the target of Sean\u2019s \u201cIDWFU,\u201d a track that has since been certified 4x Platinum.

However, the series was unable to garner a favourable viewership to stay afloat, as the streaming service just announced they are pulling the plug after just one season.\n\nThe show explored racial tensions in America following a hit-and-run that resulted in the death of an African-American teenager at the hands of a cop. Upon being notified of the accident, the local police force tries to cover up the incident and erase any indication that one of their officers was involved.\n\nThe show received a positive response from viewers and critics alike, but was not enough to secure a devoted and sizeable audience. \u201cWe loved working with Veena Sud, Regina King and the cast and crew of Seven Seconds. Together they created a compelling, timely and relevant crime drama. The first season is a complete, stand-alone story that we are proud to feature on Netflix for years to come,\u201d reveals Cindy Holland, VP of Originals at Netflix.\n\nThe decision to halt production of Seven Seconds is a direct result of Netflix cutting back on original programming amid an $8 billion spending budget. The show will now join Girlboss, The Get Down and Gypsy as series that were only given one season before being cancelled. Get the FULL story at www.itsKenBarbie.com Are you sad to see the show go?

Nene was dropped from the tour due to a rape joke that did not sit well with people. During a hosting gig, RHOA star told a fan that she hoped she got raped by her Uber driver on the way home; fans everywhere as well as Xscape were not here for it. Yesterday evening on October 18th, the official Xscape page confirmed via Instagram that Zonnique will in fact be joining the Great Xscape Tour.\n\nZonnique started out in a girl group called the OMG Girlz. The group had two chart topping singles, and with their growing success they ended up landing a spot on the Scream Tour as well as on reality television. The group later on decided to split up in 2015 to pursue personal endeavors.\n\nSince becoming a solo artist Zonnique has released her first single featuring Young Thug \u201cNun For Free,\u201d then went on to release her EP Love Jones. Still dabbling in reality television, you can also catch Zonnique on their family\u2019s hit TV show T.I.

As simple as that.\u201d When asked for her reaction is Tamar forgave Herbert, she stated that the 44-year-old music producer needs professional help. \u201cI think that if a person really means what they\u2019re doing then they\u2019ll go and get help. I think he needs to go and get counseling before someone gets killed.\u201d Last month, Tamar filed for divorce from her husband/manager after nearly a decade of marriage.

Although the clips were short, it was a \u201cqualitatively significant\u201d use, meaning that they actually impact the recognizability of the song. In fact, the track prominently opens with two of the vocal clips, completely and clearly audible, without any digital reprocessing.\n\nBrown wrote a 66-page decision explaining, \u201cPlaintiffs have plausibly alleged in their complaint that Defendants did not change or alter the \u2018expressive content or message\u2019 of Anthony Barr\u00e9\u2019s Youtube videos, but rather used unmodified clips without adding anything new. [T]he Court concludes at this stage of litigation that \u2018the copyright law\u2019s goal of promoting the Progress of Science and useful Arts\u2019 would not be better served by allowing Defendants\u2019 use of Plaintiffs\u2019 copyrighted material without authorization or compensation.

It all began in 2012 when Banks was invited to Nicki\u2019s international leg of her Pink Friday tour.

The two slightly exchanged words again in 2016 and Banks\u2019 took Remy Ma\u2019s side in the \u201cNicki vs. Remy\u201d beef.\n\nRecently, Nicki has been a more positive topic in Banks\u2019 debates about female rap, with the rapper defending the Queens native\u2019s legacy. In her Instagram DMs to the rapper, Banks praised Nicki\u2019s artistry and vowed to never speak negatively about her again. \u201cNow that I\u2019m growing up I\u2019m realizing a lot about what it means to be a strong woman and you showed me nothing but strength and perseverance from day one,\u201d she said. \u201cInside all of us, there\u2019s a little black girl that cries and the last thing I want to see is that little black girl cry.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re very talented and very smart.

Offset has contested the validity of the screencaps, responding to Powell\u2019s tweet by pointing out the avatar shown in the messages does not match her timeline.\n\nOf course, within DMs, avatars appear in their current form regardless of when they are viewed. Offset stated on Twitter that his avatar (the album cover for Without Warning) was added to his profile following the release in 2017, but the messages being shown are said to be from 2016. Powell countered with the claim that the screenshot itself was taken on December 30, 2017, just after Offset\u2019s lawyers had gone to TMZ with claims of extortion. She later posted a video that showed Offset\u2019s current avatar attached to the DMs. If the screenshots are authentic, it would mean that Offset did lie about knowing Powell, but, of course, it only tells one part of the story.\n\nPowell continued to extend the offer for Offset to take a DNA test to prove once and for all whether or not he is the father of her child. She mentioned a date in which he should have the test completed in Denver, though it is unclear if he has been served with papers that require him to do so.\n\nOn Friday, Powell revealed that she had given birth to a baby girl. She stated that the baby\u2019s name was Karma Kiari Cephus, pulling from Offset\u2019s government name Kiari Kendrell Cephus.

A representative for Jennifer Hudson gave a statement to People detailing what happened. \u201cThey have been in the process of ending their relationship for a number of months. Today, Jennifer requested and received a protective order against her ex-fianc\u00e9.

According to TMZ, the 61-year-old comedian is being sued by a former guest on his TV talk show. The plaintiff, Dominique Collier, claims Harvey and the series\u2019 production company portrayed her as an overtly sexual single mom who was in desperate need of a makeover. Collier says the segment was exaggerated, contrived, and emotionally damaging.\n\nThe suit states the woman was brought on the show after she responded to a casting call for \u201csingle professional women who like to show off their looks.\u201d Collier said she was told by producers that the segment would simply showcase her life as a single mother who was also working as a fitness model\u2014both of which were true; however, the woman claims that the actual segment was much different, and far more humiliating, than what she was told.\n\nAccording to TMZ, Collier arrived on the set in 2016 wearing a conservative long-sleeve blouse and a pencil skirt. She was told by production that she needed to change and was given a form-fitting outfit that showed more skin. But that wasn\u2019t the worst of it, Collier claims.\n\nAfter she switched her clothing, the woman was allegedly brought on stage and subjected to derogatory comments from the studio audience. Collier says the crowd was asked to judge her by holding up signs with harsh labels, such as \u201cslut,\u201d \u201cwhore,\u201d and \u201cratchet.\u201d The woman said the show pulled the \u201caudience poll\u201d from the episode after she had sent them a cease-and-desist; however, she claims that the incident was so embarrassing that it brought her to tears backstage. Collier was reportedly crying when Harvey approached her on the set to return her old clothes.\n\nCollier says the incident felt like sexual harassment, which is why she\u2019s suing the talk show host, Endemol Shine, and NBC for a minimum of $2 million.

Not being shy, the comedian-turned-actor decided to go for a true comedic classic, Mrs Doubtfire. Here's what he had to say about it: \"I'll stay on the Robin Williams train and say that if I could jump into Mrs. Doubtfire. That was a very amazing performance on both ends for him. I think that's one I'd love to get to play in.\" In case you don't remember, the Mrs Doubtfire centered around Robin Williams dressing up as a woman and posing as a nanny named Mrs. Doubtfire so that he can still be close to his kids. Not only is it really reliant on Williams' as a performer, but it was very much a beloved product of its time. The idea of remaking it, is a pretty tall order. And one that likely wouldn't make fans of the original very happy. Then again, it's not about what fans of the original think. If there's money to be made, Hollywood will remake just about anything, apparently.\nThe original movie was a massive hit, bringing in $441 million worldwide, working from just a $25 million budget. That's a nice return and, given Kevin Hart's popularity, it's not crazy to think people would show up to watch something like this.Get the FULL details at www.itsKenBarbie.com Would you be open to seeing Hart remake the classic comedy?

The three women and their rapper partners rack up a lot of dough throughout the year, but a new report suggests that the women in their relationships do most of the earning. MissyEmpire came through with the numbers, showing approximately how much each power couple makes per annum, and the results show a huge wage gap between genders.\n\nWhile the wage gap between men and women has been highly reported in the recent past, nearly all of the most well-known celebrity couples reveal women making more money than their male partners. In the case of Bey and Jay, Beyonc\u00e9 makes more than double her husband\u2019s salary, raking in a whopping $105 million annually while Jigga brings home 45.5 M\u2019s. Although Kanye is accomplished in both the music and fashion industries, Kim earns the majority of their household income, with her salary at $42 million and Ye\u2019s at $17.5M. Kylie and Travis collectively make nearly $42 million per year, but 41 of those M\u2019s are made by Kylie in the most substantial wage difference of the bunch.\n\nShout out to all the women making their money and shifting power balances in their careers.

Earlier today, a video of Cardi B was caught walking to her vehicle and when asked about her alleged pregnancy, she was relatively silent. However, it looks like her fianc\u00e9e is putting the rumors to rest.\n\nWhile shopping in L.A. today, Offset was approached by TMZ who tried to find the scoop on whether Cardi B is actually pregnant. While Cardi\u2019s reps have allegedly suggested that he is, the rapper suggested otherwise. He wasn\u2019t too talkative but the cameraman asked the rapper whether he was excited to be a father. \u201cI\u2019m already a father of three.

Cardi joins fellow celebrities Gordon Ramsey, Rebel Wilson and Anthony Hopkins, who all provide a comical spin on Amazon\u2019s technology.\n\nFor Cardi\u2019s appearance, a kid asks Alexa \u201chow far Mars is?\u201d to which Cardi hilariously replies: \u201cHow am I supposed to know?

He also instructed her on how to make the forced anal sex less painful, she said in court. \u201cHe would call me his puppet and say I had no say in what he did to me,\u201d the girl testified.\n\nThe girl said that the alleged abuse began in April 2015, while she was living with her mother and Maraj on Long Island. It started with Maraj rubbing his erection on her but, she said, escalated one morning when she went in to greet him. \u201cIt was a Saturday morning,\u201d the girl said. \u201cI had went to him to go say, \u2018Good morning.\u2019 I had hugged him as usual. I went to go lie next to him as I usually do. When I did that, he told me to go close the door. He told me to take off my pants. Then he told me to come under the covers with him and he started caressing me.\u201d The teen testified that Maraj had sex with her, then ejaculated in her mouth. From then on, he frequently raped her after school. \u201cWe would have sex in his bedroom, in my bedroom, in the basement,\u201d the teen said.\n\nShe told the court that Maraj tried to make her think the attacks were her fault by telling her that she was sending him signals. He told her that she had been brushing herself up against him, so she wanted it to happen.\n\nThat summer, Maraj began anally sodomizing her, she testified. \u201cHe used lubricant and told me to breathe properly and not to clench so it wouldn\u2019t hurt so much,\u201d she said. \u201cIt hurt. I told him to stop and tried to push him away.\u201d The victim testified that the day her 8-year-old brother walked in and caught Maraj in the act, she \u201cwas on my forearms on the bed and my pants were pulled down.\u201d She told her brother not to tell anyone what happened for fear that they would be \u201csent away.\u201d Get the FULL detail at ItsKenBarbie.com "}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/cec2f0122dfe0aa8496b991b00972bd7/5B6356B0/t51.2885-15/e35/25008979_349493152189492_2291939512881774592_n.jpg", "tags": ["#PrettyBoos", "#KenCosmetics"], "comments": 0, "likes": 319, "date": "2017-11-25T22:01:09.000Z", "description": "\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude0d I love my "}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/18b4aec03e01dea58806b89ee1120c5b/5B9AA5AB/t51.2885-15/e35/30078767_167094527327318_4059576566756147200_n.jpg", "tags": ["#nicki", "#nickiminaj", "#minaj", "#onika", "#nm4", "#barbs", "#barbz", "#AzealiaBanks", "#azealia", "#banks", "#annawintour", "#chunli", "#barbietingz", "#femalerappers", "#femalerapper"], "comments": 25, "likes": 1624, "date": "2018-04-13T01:28:44.000Z", "description": "WELL I GUESS PRAYING AND CHOPPING ALL THOSE CHICKENS WORKED \u2615\ufe0f\ud83e\udd2a \ud83d\udc14 ... would you be here for a Nicki x Azealia collaboration? \ud83d\udc40 "}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/d67629cffeb3d33ecfbeeaabb053374c/5B7F01D0/t51.2885-15/e35/26226406_401163153631133_104084280400936960_n.jpg", "tags": ["#cardib", "#cardi", "#iamcardib", "#bardi", "#bardib", "#bardigang", "#bodakyellow", "#moneymoves", "#bloodyshoes", "#grammyweekend", "#bartiercardi", "#missy", "#missyelliot", "#missymisdemeanorelliott", "#entertainment", "#entertainmentnews", "#entertainmentblog", "#gossip", "#celebrities", "#celebrityblogger", "#kenbarbie", "#itskenbarbie"], "comments": 2, "likes": 633, "date": "2018-01-26T18:35:49.000Z", "description": "The success of a single like \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d has afforded Cardi B the opportunity to meet some of her idols up close and personal over the six or eight months and, by the sound of her latest Instagram post, she\u2019s loving every minute of it.\n\nRecording the encounter on Instagram, Cardi immortalized the moment that she met one of the trailblazing female icons from the history of hip-hop, Missy Elliott.

Again it was noticeable, but in that scene, it wasn\u2019t difficult to believe that a couple who has been together for years would skip safe sex and take their chances with each other.

Peacocking via a colorful bow tie here or a flashy footwear choice there is usually the extent of older menswear diversity. However, Laurence Fishburne has arisen as the unlikely champion for mixing things up on the step-and-repeat, ditching the suit and tie entirely.\n\nThe Black-ish actor arrived at the 2018 Golden Globes in what appeared to be a black silk kurta pyjamas, a traditional garment that originated on the Indian subcontinent consisting of a long top over loose trousers, his embroidered with mandalas. (Due to trade routes between Africa and India, similarly cut garments were seen in some east African nations and Muslim populations as well, though with different names.) Fishburne topped off the look with red shoes and a red dhoti, which is a length of cloth that is wrapped around the waist and tied at the front.\n\nWe were surprised, to say the least, that the actor chose this particular ensemble, considering at his last red carpet event he was photographed in a black tuxedo and poppy yellow bow tie. But we were even more surprised when Fishburne turned up at the NAACP Image Awards just one week later in the same kurta pyjamas and dhoti.\n\nWhat exactly inspired the actor\u2019s sartorial choice is unclear, as it appears he did not give any interviews relating to his ensemble. Last summer, however, for a more casual occasion, he was spotted in what resembled a red kurta and simple black trousers, so the pick is not entirely out of the blue.\n\nIf it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it, maybe? Either way social media\u2019s reactions to Fishburne\u2019s choice to do a double take seemed to vary from support to negative? Get the FULL story at www.itsKenBarbie.com What do you guys think?

According to documents obtained by the Blast, the litigation battle between the two has taken a turn for the worse. Apparently a shared hug, and their public outing have done little to repair their soured relationship.\n\nAn Instagram post, of the pair hanging out at a club in Miami, appeared to show the two former colleagues in good spirits, with Birdman referring to Wayne as his son yet again.\n\nIn good conscience, it appears they held off from talking business during their club encounter. Things came to a head shortly thereafter. Lil Wayne is fiercely confident in his case against Birdman. Sources indicate that \u201cThere will be no connection, no ties, and no business relationship,\u201d between them.\n\nWayne is suing his former boss and father figure for $51 Million. Birdman is accused of withholding millions. Wayne is also seeking an out from his Cash Money deal to go along with aforementioned compensatory package. Much of the infighting stems from Birdman\u2019s unwillingness to release the Carter V, amid a certainty it would go over well. Stay tuned to itsKenBarbie.com for more on the story as it comes in.

As Deadspin notes, Foerster is seen allegedly using a $20 bill snorting and talking into a video camera.\n\nAccording to the woman, Kijuana Nige, Foerster sent her the video professing his love for her and she uploaded the clip to her Facebook on Sunday. Nige, who apparently works as a model in Las Vegas, is milking the moment for what it\u2019s worth by pointing out the hypocrisy of critics of the protests but noting the lack of outrage that a white NFL coach is doing lines.\n\nFoerster, 55, was known as one of the highest-paid assistant coaches in the league with a reported salary range of $2.5 to $3 million per year. Forester, who turns 56 this Thursday, says he will seek professional help.\n\nCheck out the video along with Kijuana's posts at www.itsKenBarbie.com (A Warning: the video below depicts drug use so use caution when playing.)

He\u2019s been teasing some new music including his debut album 4275 which has yet to get a release date. However, the singer has a lot in store for his fans. Unfortunately, the rapper faced some issues earlier today. Footage of his arrest in South Beach surfaced without much context to it. However, new reports have surfaced that explained what happened.\n\nJacquees was arrested earlier today in South Beach for allegedly driving without a seatbelt and failing to obey a lawful demand, TMZ reports. The singer was stopped by a Miami Beach officer while he was driving down Ocean Drive earlier today. According to police, the \u201cB.E.D\u201d crooner was pulled over for driving without a license and when asked to show his driver\u2019s license, Jacquees refused. The officer then told him to exit the vehicle, which Jacquees did, but he apparently refused to walk with the officer to the sidewalk. The police allege that Jacquees yelled, \u201cDo not touch me.\u201d By the time this occured, Jacquees drew a large crowd of people who were on spring break which prompted the police officer to call more officers to the scene. The singer was ultimately cuffed and taken to the police station on two misdemeanors: failure to obey a lawful command and a seat belt infraction.

Morgan maintains she was not fired and took the industry standard 10 percent fee for any bookings.\nGiven the nature of the claims on both sides, things have the potential to get ugly.

As we reported last week, Usher came forward with a statement to Laura that said she assumed her own risk of contracting an STD when she slept with him. \u201cWith a one in six chance that any given partner could have genital herpes, [she] assumed the risk of contracting an STD each and every time she chose to have unprotected sex with a casual, consensual partner,\u201d Usher said in legal documents.\n\nLaura said she had sex with Usher two times, where one time was unprotected. She alleges that after the second time hooking up with Usher she noticed an \u201cunusual bump on the inside of her cheek\u201d and later found a bump \u201cthe size of a green pea.\u201d Keep up with the story at www.itsKenBarbie.com "}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/8c9fdfc8d96f9949f9e10cd444295cb7/5B96BBFD/t51.2885-15/e35/25024696_1509757395807886_4311667069444685824_n.jpg", "tags": ["#racisttrash", "#jealous", "#KKK", "#thirsty", "#youwannaactgrown", "#rhoa", "#realhousewivesofatlanta", "#realhousewives", "#nene", "#neneleakes", "#kikzolciak", "#kimzolciakbiermann", "#atl", "#briellebiermann", "#roaches", "#entertainment", "#entertainmentnews", "#media", "#gossip", "#gossipblog", "#gossipblogger", "#celebrities", "#celebritynews", "#celebrityblogger", "#kenbarbie", "#itskenbarbie"], "comments": 6, "likes": 341, "date": "2017-10-11T20:13:18.000Z", "description": "Kim Zolciak has hired a high-powered attorney and is demanding an apology from \u201cReal Housewives of Atlanta\u201d castmate NeNe Leakes for her social media tirades calling her daughter Brielle \u201cracist trash.\u201d Leakes was offended when Brielle posted a Snapchat video recently showing bugs in a Leakes bathroom in her home in Duluth.\n\nHere\u2019s part of what Leakes wrote: \u201cYou had to stoop so low and be so disgusting "}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/8ee8bc858a46a624d94bc6a561cb82b4/5B78FAE8/t51.2885-15/e35/26870767_563005504052574_139365787470135296_n.jpg", "tags": ["#rasualbutler", "#leahlabelle", "#labelle", "#prayersup", "#rip", "#nba", "#americanidol", "#entertainment", "#entertainmentnews", "#entertainmentblog", "#gossip", "#gossipblog", "#celebrities", "#celebrityblogger", "#kenbarbie", "#itskenbarbie"], "comments": 14, "likes": 490, "date": "2018-01-31T21:06:17.000Z", "description": "Former NBA player Rasual Butler and his wife, Leah LaBelle, were reportedly killed in a car accident in Studio City, California last night.\n\nAccording to a report by TMZ Sports, Butler lost control of his Range Rover at about 2 a.m., struck a parking meter and slammed into a wall.

According to Billboard, who spoke with the network\u2019s President Chris McCarthy, TRL is actually planning on growing the franchise to include three different day parts. The network has secretly been working on a morning & night edition of the show over the past couple month that\u2019s dropping this Summer. \u201cIt\u2019s thriving. We\u2019re expanding the franchise and will have three TRLs by summer,\u201d McCarthy tells THR. (The revival\u2019s October premiere drew just 166,000 live same-day viewers.) \u201cTRL has delivered incredible growth on linear, and we\u2019ve experienced two to three times the growth in our video streams, and TRL is big piece of it \u2014 and that\u2019s why we\u2019re expanding it; we want more.\u201d Having taken a break from March, TRL\u2019s afternoon show will return to the air April 9 as planned as a two-hour block with its roster of rotating hosts and social media stars serving as correspondents. \u201cWe\u2019ve always had the March hiatus planned,\u201d McCarthy says of the flagship afternoon edition. \u201cWe\u2019re expanding to target different demographics and dayparts. \u2026 All three [versions of TRL] will be airing by June. We have no plans of not having TRL on our linear network; there won\u2019t be a time when we don\u2019t have it on. The show has been killing it for us.\u201d So while you thought TRL was being cancelled, it\u2019s quite the opposite and it\u2019s dropping more shows come this Summer. Stay tuned.

In recent times, he hasn\u2019t had any new lawsuits to face but that seems to have changed and this time, his son, King Cairo, seems to be listed in the suit as well.\n\nAccording to TMZ, Tyga and his five year old son, King Cairo, are being sued by Simon Cowell\u2019s ex-fiancee, Mezhgan Hussainy. The report claims that Tyga rented a Beverly Hills house from Hussainy for $40K a month. He initially moved in in March of 2017 and was doing good on his payments for a while. However, Tyga\u2019s being accused of not paying his rent for a while now.

From the Lil Yachty interview, to the infamous \u201cBad & Boujee\u201d incident, Everyday Struggle became an integral cog in the hip-hop media machine, delivering hilarious, insightful, and at times frustrating content. Overall, the series was really starting to grow into its own, and by the end of the debut \u201cseason,\u201d Joe and Ak had developed an entertaining and respectable chemistry. However, as the year edged to a close, talk of renewed contracts became more and more frequent, and now, it would appear that Joe\u2019s future with the series remains uncertain.\n\nYesterday\u2019s episode found DJ Whoo Kid taking up hosting duties for the week, citing Joe Budden\u2019s decision to take paternity leave. However, Budden cleared the air on Twitter, claiming that Complex was using his child to mask \u201cinternal chaos.\u201d Afterward, Joe proceeded to fire off some Tweets addressing his decision to seemingly move on from Everyday Struggle, encouraging creators to remain steadfast in their goals and to \u201cknow their worth.\u201d Plus, he also claims that they didn\u2019t even give him a proper goodbye. If so, it\u2019s a sad day for Everyday Struggle fans, but it seems as if Joe will continue to make an impression on the game. On the other hand, perhaps this is all a hard-nosed negotiation scheme, and we\u2019ll soon be seeing Budden back in the co-host chair.

However, ever controversial rapper Azealia Banks is threatening to have her entire music catalog stripped from the streaming giant if they do not meet one specific demand.\n\nBanks\u2019 material has been streamed over 200 million times on the platform but, apparently that doesn\u2019t mean much to the rapper as she feels professionally offended by being included on a new playlist Spotify has released. The list in question is the app\u2019s \u201cOne Hit Wonder Playlist,\u201d which features nostalgic novelty songs of the past ala Vanilla Ice \u201cIce Ice Baby,\u201d \u201cMacarena\u201d by Los Del Rio, \u201cA Thousand Miles\u201d by Vanessa Carlton, and \u201cWhat Would You Do?\u201d by City High, just to name a few and give you an idea of where this is going.\n\nBanks\u2019 own breakout hit \u2018212\u2019 found it\u2019s way on to the list which features 100 songs, and the rapper was not one bit happy about it. Almost immediately posting to her IG story, \u201cReally about to just remove my music from Spotify all together.

To be fair, while Azealia has consistently released quality music since her debut with \u201c212,\u201d however none of it has seen chart success. As a matter of fact, \u2018212\u2019 didn\u2019t see any success in the United States as it did not chart, especially compared to it\u2019s run in the United Kingdom where it peaked at No. 12.

She broke through with one of the biggest hits of the year and now she\u2019s getting the victory lap she deserves at the BET Hip-Hop Awards. With three wins during the show (Best New Artist, Hustler of the Year, & Impact Track), Cardi took the stage to perform her No. 1 hit \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d and she did not disappoint.\n\nCardi waltzed on stage in a huge, full-length fur coat with several patterns and colors, only to disrobe and reveal a stunning pink outfit complete a glistening top. She performed with the energy that has made her a household name and may have topped her MTV VMA performance on her big night. It\u2019s a coronation of sorts for Cardi, and her first bit of award show recognition this year, even though it surely won\u2019t be her last.\n\nNobody really knows what\u2019s next for Cardi, aside from a soon to be released freestyle to coincide with her birthday (tomorrow Oct 11th) and her debut album on the way, but nobody is certain when.

On Monday afternoon (Jan. 8), the rapper, whose self-made, aspirational underdog status has helped make him a lowkey idol for folks all around, uploaded an Instagram post in which he spoke down on the gay community.\nNipsey\u2019s offensive gesture came in the form of the caption for said post, which includes an image of a large group of Black boys and Black men. \u201cDemonstration speaks louder than Conversation,\u201d wrote Nip. \u201cThey gone feed us every image of our men and boys but this one. No hyper violent\u2026No homo sexual\u2026No abandoners\u2026.JUS STRONG BLAC MEN AND YOUNG Men. RESPECT TO MY BIG HOMIE @bigu1 for Leading with love and intelligence. GOD IS WITH US WHO CAN GO AGAINST US \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffe.\u201d Nipsey\u2019s comment, of course, echoes a sentiment shared by a number in a certain subset of the Black community. There\u2019s a belief that the media conspires to show Black men in a light that either makes them appear too violent or feminine. This group equates homosexuality with weakness, and now, folks are getting the sense that Nipsey belongs to that group.\n\nNipsey Hussle\u2019s since defended his comments, and unsurprisingly, even with hip-hop\u2019s increasingly outward acceptance of the gay community, he\u2019s not backing down. \u201cI ain\u2019t gotta be politically correct becuae I ain\u2019t standing on Nobody else\u2019s platform,\u201d tweeted Nipsey, whose album Victory Lap is due out in February. \u201cI believe in LOVE and acceptance but u ain\u2019t gone piss on my head and tell me it\u2019s raining\u2026.NONE.

Deadline reports the Network has ordered a two-hour movie, which will serve as the Being Mary Jane TV series finale, when it airs in 2018.\n\nAiring on the BET cable channel, Being Mary Jane revolves around the life of news anchor, Mary Jane Paul (Gabrielle Union). Margaret Avery, Aaron D. Spears, Richard Brooks, BJ Britt Jr., Raven Goodwin, Richard Roundtree, Valarie Pettiford, Chike Okonkwo, and Michael Ealy also star. The cancellation or ending does not come as a huge shock. Originally, BET wanted to shoot seasons four and five back-to-back. Gabrielle Union fought that though, on the grounds of break stipulations in her contract. Although eventually, the lawsuit was settled, there was no further mention of a Being Mary Jane season five renewal. What\u2019s more, the ratings were way down during what is now this TV show\u2019s fourth and finale season.\n\nBET released the following statement in regards to the cancellation: \u201cBeing Mary Jane has been a landmark series not only for BET, but for African American women around the world who saw themselves in Mary Jane, her family, friends and coworkers. From the captivating storytelling, to the richly complex characters, to the powerful issues tackled on the series, we remain immensely proud,\u201d said Connie Orlando, EVP and Head of Programming, BET Networks. \u201cWe are grateful to the cast and creators of Being Mary Jane, who have worked tirelessly to bring this world to vivid life over the past 4 seasons. We also thank the many loyal viewers whose hearts and minds were captured every week, and kept Mary Jane trending worldwide. We look forward to closing out Mary Jane\u2019s journey with a series finale that is sure to blow fans away!\u201d As a big fan of the show as well as it\u2019s star Gabrielle Union, I\u2019m sad to see the series go.

Fans of the couple know that Fetty has had moments of weakness, in which he ended up cheating on Sky with another Love And Hip-Hop actress, Masika Kalysha; in fact, they actually ended up having a baby together.

Yet Fetty ultimately came through for his baby mama, and spent the entire time by her side, making sure she and their new baby were healthy. Wile waiting at the hospital, Fetty took to IG live to interact with some fans, informing them that Sky was doing well, and that their baby girl was still doing well. In the footage, you can see that the man is clearly sleep deprived, but you have to respect him holding it down for him family, and looking to be there for his unborn child.\n\nWhile Fetty is currently in a relationship with another woman, it seems as if he\u2019s ultimately on good terms with Sky. There\u2019s moment in which Fetty goes to visit her in the hospital bed, and finds her scrolling through his Instagram feed, laughing as she bumps one of his songs.

Wayne says Cash Money was ordered to produce documents but continues to refuse to turn over important information needed in the case.\n\nHe points out while Cash Money claims that their company has earned over $200 million in cash flow, it has no accounting records, no general ledger, no bank account records and no tax returns at all.\n\nWayne says the information Cash Money is refusing to turn over includes documents relating to Nicki Minaj and Drake. He\u2019s demanded all records pertaining to Nicki and the label since 2011. The label claimed they have no documents, but Wayne says that\u2019s impossible due to Nicki releasing albums with the company since 2011.

Further, he says they refuse to hand over all tax returns from 2011. He says, \u201cUnless Cash Money admits to criminal failure to file tax returns for 2011 to present, Cash Money must produce these returns.\u201d The judge has yet to rule on the motion.

She\u2019s going to teach you how to be with me.\u2019\u201d Jones says she dated R. Kelly for a two-year period from 2011-2013, and it was during those years these accusations reportedly occurred. She says Kelly was \u201cvery abusive, physically, mentally, verbally. I think he gets some sort of satisfaction within himself, knowing that he\u2019s taking control over other people.\u201d Kelly or his representatives have yet to respond to these sick allegations, but he has always denied accusations of sexual misconduct over the years.

Granted, the album\u2019s history has been rife with delay, deception, and legal drama; still, perhaps a new dawn was on the horizon.

While they have doubtless undergone their fair shares of trials and reconciliations, it would appear that they are once again, at the very least, on \u201chugging terms.\u201d The clip showcases Birdman and Wayne hugging it out like the days of \u201cStuntin\u2019 Like My Daddy.\u201d They also appeared to exchange a few words, but the conversation was inaudible. While it\u2019s possible the pair were merely picking at old wounds, the embrace did look to stem from a place of love.\n\nCheck it out for yourself.

When Drake and Nicki Minaj were just starting to blossom into their careers, Weezy\u2019s Young Money imprint was the label that nurtured them into being the superstars they are today. Sadly, it seems that Lil Wayne want to shut down shop.\n\nLil Wayne is allegedly trying to close down the Young Money imprint, according to reports from The Blast. The feud he\u2019s been having with Birdman seems to have trickled down to his own imprint. The report says that Lil Wayne is sick of Birdman cashing in on his hard work and either wants the music label to be dealt with properly or shut down completely. Wayne reportedly said he feels he\u2019s brought an enormous amount of talent to the company, especially with Drake and Nicki Minaj, but says he was bamboozled by Birdman.\n\nIn alleged documents that Wayne filed, he\u2019s asking the court to \u201cappoint a receiver to supervise the operations of Young Money Label joint venture or order the termination of Young Money Label joint venture and appoint a liquidator.\u201d It would be the end of an era if Young Money ends up terminated as a company. It initially started as a joint venture between Wayne and Cash Money back in 2003.\n\nWayne\u2019s original beef with Birdman and Cash Money Records stems back to 2014 when Wayne said that Cash Money is refusing to release Tha Carter V and that Wayne has yet to receive his $8 million dollar advance from Birdman.\n\nDespite Wayne\u2019s claims, Birdman continues to deny that he or Wayne have any issues. A few weeks prior, Birdman went on an epic rant on his Instagram story where he said that he\u2019s taken care of Wayne regardless of what the media or others are saying. \u201cBitch, you think I ain\u2019t gonna make sure he straight?

Now, Kitti Jones, a former radio DJ and Kelly\u2019s ex-girlfriend, has shared her story in an extensive Rolling Stone feature, in which she discusses everything from the night she met the singer to the last time they saw each other in person.\n\nJones met Kelly at a concert afterparty in Dallas in June 2011, when she was instantly charmed by the singer. Things quickly took a strange turn, though, when she texted him after their initial meeting and he responded by demanding she only refer to him as \u201cdaddy.\u201d After the two had been talking regularly, via phone and text, over the next couple months, Kelly invited Jones to meet him in Denver.

As the world\u2019s most recognizable child under the age of one, Asahd has been basically everywhere, following his father\u2019s footsteps on the quest for ubiquity. And, in a rather savvy business move, Khaled made his young son the executive producer of Grateful, ensuring that the young mogul-in-training will reap some financial benefits before ever uttering a coherent sentence. Plus, if you\u2019ve ever strayed onto Khaled\u2019s Instagram feed, you\u2019ll know that Asahd is undeniably set for life, so it\u2019s no surprise that his first birthday has already amassed some insane hype.\n\nKhaled recently stopped by Jimmy Kimmel\u2019s Brooklyn set, where he spoke about Asahd\u2019s role in Grateful, as well as his upcoming birthday bash. \u201cHis birthday is Oct. 23, and speaking of him being the executive producer, the album that he\u2019s executive producer on went platinum in two months,\u201d said Khaled. \u201cIt went gold in two weeks. My biggest album, and my son is my biggest blessing. It\u2019s changed my life, man, I\u2019m happy. I love that boy.\u201d And if Khaled\u2019s involvement wasn\u2019t lavish enough, Asahd\u2019s birthday party has officially piqued the interest of none other than Diddy. Apparently, Khaled and Diddy engaged in some mogul talk, in which they decided to team up for the big day. \u201c\u201dYou know, speaking of his birthday, I just got off the phone with Puff Daddy, because we throwing the biggest birthday party for Asahd,\u201d said Khaled. \u201cIt\u2019s gone be big.

So me and Puff were talking, and we\u2019re gone do something big for Asahd.\u201d While the day has yet to arrive, there\u2019s no doubt that it will be a wild, expensive, and star studded affair.

But this time, she\u2019s claiming it\u2019s not actually her. Shortly after Chyna\u2019s oral sex video was leaked by an anonymous user on Twitter on Monday, a longer video surfaced on the same social media platform showing a woman, who looks nearly identical to Chyna, engaging in sexual intercourse with an unnamed man. Chyna however, is claiming that the 13-minute, out-of-focus video swimming around the web today is not her. Rather, it\u2019s someone who simply looks like her. And she believes that the lookalike is getting attention for herself in light of her recent misfortune.\n\nAccording to TMZ, the newest sex tape shows a woman with a similar skin tone, body type, hairstyle and wide collection of tattoos as Blac Chyna, which makes the similarities very striking between the two. But the person is reportedly an imposter \u2014 by the admission of Chyna and her team, at least. The model and reality TV star\u2019s legal team are now currently sending cease and desist letters to anyone who unlawfully publishes the video on their site, notably any porn site that is flaunting her famous name at the top of the video. But knowing the web, that\u2019s going to be easier said than done.\n\nThe newest sex tape of (supposedly not) Blac Chyna made its way onto Twitter earlier this week. In that time, it has been spreading like wildfire. It should not be confused with a separate sex tape which also made its way onto the web this week. That video, which features Chyna\u2019s former partner Mechie receiving oral sex from her, is not a point of contention. That one seems to be legit.\n\nSources close to Chyna admit \u2026 the woman in the grainy footage does have significant similarities to the reality star, but it is absolutely NOT her.\n\nWe\u2019re told Chyna\u2019s legal team has fired off more than 20 cease and desist letters to the porn sites that are hawking the video using Chyna\u2019s name. Her lawyers have also sent the letters to porn sites showing her oral sex tape with Mechie.

Kylie and Tyga had been linked together for years and when the Kardashian-Jenner girl was rumored to be pregnant, some of her fans speculated that she was being so private because it was her ex\u2019s baby. While the rumor has continued steadily even after the birth of Stormi, Tyga insists that he has nothing to do with the situation. \u201cI\u2019ve never said anything about someone else\u2019s child or family insinuating my involvement; and will never do so,\u201d began the rapper on Twitter. Tyga has been quiet about the gossip surrounding Kylie & Travis\u2019 offspring since the information was made public and he is just now beginning to clear his name. He continued, \u201cPlease, stop spreading false stories and attacking people\u2019s families. I have nothing to do with any of that.

Although it was a celebratory moment for her, being her seventh Vogue cover, many people online weren\u2019t happy with her presence with the publication.\n\nThe 37-year-old is of Armenian descent, but that means nothing to Twitter users who were quick to question why Kim was gracing the cover rather than a woman of Indian descent. When Kendall graced Vogue India in May 2017, she too received the same backlash prompting the publication to respond with: \u201cIn the last 10 years, Vogue India has had only 12 international covers, including Kendall Jenner in 2017,\u201d they said. \u201cTherefore, statistically, 90% of our covers are Indian! And we are proud of that. India has given the world so many beautiful faces to admire. After all, we are Vogue, an international brand, and we want to give the love back by featuring some of the best international celebrities on over covers.

Take how things went down with the Urban Decay Naked Heat palette. Once everyone fell in love with its mix of bronzy-red colors, tons of other brands came out with their own spins. Or even the ever popular Anastasia Beverly Hills Glow Kits, they had the entire beauty industry squirming to release it\u2019s own highlighter palette. Now it seems the internet is wondering if something similar happened with Kylie Cosmetics\u2019 new set of concealers. News broke a few days ago that the brand is dropping 30 shades of concealer, and almost immediately Fenty Beauty comparisons began.\n\nFenty Beauty broke ground and released its foundation in 40 colors, it proved once and for all that there\u2019s money to be made from catering to everyone\u2019s shades, and the dark colors sold out ASAP\u2014driving home the message that women of color are ready to buy. As one of the first brands to include women of all colors in its starting shade range, there\u2019s no denying that Fenty set a new precedent for beauty brands.\n\nHowever, quite a few other brands were making wide shade shade ranges for both foundation and concealer in life pre-Fenty. But the timing is what seems to turning some people off. No one knows when Jenner started developing her concealers, and it\u2019s also only fair to mention that her previous products had no shade limitations because they were simply eyeshadows and lipsticks, but some are reading it like she saw the money that Fenty made from its inclusivity, and broadened the concealer\u2019s shade range in response.\nHowever you feel about the concealers\u2019 backstory, I would think we all can agree that it\u2019s a welcome change that Kylie\u2019s concealers are so inclusive from the get-go. I will say that up until now, that hasn\u2019t been the norm\u2014foundation and concealer products from quite a few mainstream brands.

He didn\u2019t want to split their earnings equally.\n\nThe group stayed defunct. They often feud online, as Tyrese refuses to an equal partnership.\n\nWell, Tank is looking for a job. Perhaps to diss his bandmate, he went seeking for bread at the hands of the same person Tyrese is feuding with.\n\nAnd The Rock, to show he had some additional petty up his sleeve, immediately responded to Tank, and even called him \u201cbrother\u201d.

Now, we\u2019re seeing even more proof of that, with Kim Kardashian\u2019s new perfume line grossing a sizable fortune after being on the market for just one day.\n\nAccording to a new report from TMZ, Kim\u2019s fragrance hit the world of online shopping on Wednesday (November 15th) and, in spite of the fact that no customers have been able to get even a small whiff of what the line has to offer, the revenue that was grossed in the first 24 hours seems unimaginable. The reality star\u2019s perfume brought in a supposed $10 million in its first day of sales alone, giving industry competition a new force to be reckoned with. In fact, the revenue stream hit $1 million in the first hour alone. The report states that customers are able to choose between three different fragrances: Crystal Gardenia, Crystal Gardenia Oud and Crystal Gardenia Citrus.

However, once police conducted a further investigation into the collision, they found that the Nissan Ultima that turned in front of Williams as the traffic light changed violated Williams\u2019s right of way as a driver.\n\nThis comes as a legal victory for Williams, who just recently experienced another misfortune when her home was burglarized during the 2017 U.S. Open, losing a reported $400,000 in personal property.

For example, Wendy Williams is noted, after she just blasted Kim for her recent nude photos, where she alluded that Kanye wasn\u2019t paying enough attention to her.\n\nEven Lindsay Lohan is on the list who just a few days ago replied to Kim\u2019s new box braids saying \u201cI don\u2019t get it.\u201d Kim responded saying she \u201cdidn\u2019t get\u201d Lindsay\u2019s newfound accent. Blac Chyna, who is suing Kim, and Taylor Swift, who has always had off vibes with Kanye is also on the list.\n\nClearly, Kim is trying to show love to any and all in light of V-Day and her new collection Check out the video and Kim's list at www.itsKenBarbie.com What do you think of her gesture?

According to TMZ, the Culture 2 trifecta are being hit with a lawsuit for allegedly inciting a riot, which culminated in six people getting stabbed. It\u2019s interesting how one might think of blaming Migos when a man with his own agency and free will shoved a knife into another man, but it would appear the group will have yet another legal hurdle thrown their way. The incident in question arose at a 2015 Albany concert, which, for some context, came on the heels of Rich N***a Timeline.\n\nApparently, the group pulled the classic hip-hop show maneuver of arriving hours late, which the fans did not appreciate. Moreover, Offset, Takeoff, and Quavo were apparently drunk and stoned, reeking of liquor and reefer. The report also claims that the group refused to partake in a meet-and-greet, despite the fact that some fans had already paid for it. Suffice it to say, the tension was building, and the group was allegedly doing their part to rile people up; TMZ claims that the group were encouraging and cheering fans to fight.\n\nNow, the venue is suing the group, accusing Migos of being responsible for people being stabbed, robbed, assaulted, injured, the works. According to the suit, Migos were watching the mayhem from the stage, laughing and encouraging further escalation. Video of the brawl can be seen below, but I recommend you watch it on mute. Otherwise, prepare to subject your ears to someone repeatedly screaming \u201cWORLDSTAR\u201d with such voice-cracking passion you\u2019d think it was a battlecry.

Fortunately, everything seems to be going well with the newlyweds, but the reality star is reportedly butting heads with Real Housewives of Atlanta producers.\n\nAccording to TMZ, producers have given Kenya an ultimatum: chronicle your marriage on the show or surrender your peach!\n\nIn June, Kenya secretly married restaurateur and former banker Marc Daily in a private St. Lucia ceremony. She kept the relationship quiet because her new husband wants nothing to do with RHOA. We already knew he doesn\u2019t like the drama it involves Kenya in, and TMZ reports he doesn\u2019t like how black men are portrayed on the show.\n\nKenya is fighting with production and fighting for her marriage because there\u2019s nothing in her contract that states he must be on the show. Furthermore, she doesn\u2019t want to jeopardize her new marriage because she\u2019s spent so long finding a husband\n\nReality TV, the Real Housewives franchise in particular, has been known to ruin marriages. Cynthia Bailey, Porsha Williams, Phaedra Parks, and even NeNe Leakes can all speak on this. However, I doubt Kenya will be willing to walk away from the show that brought her newfound relevancy.\n\nShe\u2019s clever, but she better hatch a plan real quick. As we reported earlier this week, producers are eyeing model Eva Marcille to potentially replace a few housewives. Cynthia and Porsha were named on the chopping block, but Kenya might find her peach right beside theirs. Get the FULL details on that at www.itsKenBarbie.com\n\nKenya, you in danger, girl.

It was designed by Elliot Avianne, the jeweler who has created inventive pieces for all of the Migos rappers as well as Lil Uzi Vert, 21 Savage, and more.\n\nEarlier this week, Cardi showed off some of her own jewelry that was sent to her by Offset. \u201cI was gonna get you something that cost way less than this, but now I gotta up it up,\u201d she said. Looking at Offset\u2019s new bling, we\u2019d say they\u2019re more than even.\n\nNo word on how much the piece actually cost, but we know these things do not come cheap. Lil Uzi Cert recently dropped $350,000 for the upside-down cross chain Elliot designed him for the Grammys. Offset\u2019s Ric Flair chain, which was given to him by Quality Control\u2019s Pee for his 26th Birthday cost $70,000. It also earned the respect of Ric Flair himself.

Law enforcement says DJ Mustard and his friend reportedly started walking away without the bag when they were tracked down by LAX police.\n\nThe two were separated and questioned individually.

He apparently is still happy for Gucc that he came out of prison a better man and cleaned up his act in a big way, staying on the right side of the law ever since. Finally, he actually admires Guwop\u2019s latest records, even though the main reason might be because of who produced some of them.\n\nWhat do you think?

One of the biggest stories all day has been Kanye\u2019s expressive nature on Twitter, sharing his love for Donald Trump and fighting back against media outlets misusing his words. His wife, Kim Kardashian, has chimed in thus far, and so has Donald Trump himself. While they are both supporting Kanye\u2019s use of free speech, Azealia Banks claims that unlike Kim\u2019s thoughts, \u201cKanye is not ahead of his time\u201d because she said everything he has during the actual election.\n\nWriting a lengthy post on her Instagram, Azealia shared her thoughts on Kanye\u2019s supposed presidential run in 2024 while also giving her opinion on his method of internet engagement. Addressing Kim directly, Banks reposted one of the reality star\u2019s tweets, adding, \u201cI said alllll of these things during the election. Y\u2019all are aggravating the black people at the expense of dragging their outrage into more clicks/streams etc for whatever Kanye is about to drop. Outrage is internet engagement algorithm 101, y\u2019all are not slick.\u201d Taking things a step further, the \u201c212\u201d artist dissed Ye\u2019s way of thought, saying, \u201cNothing at all profound, necessary or eloquent about anything your husband says. I wish you would make him read a book cover to cover before you send that black man into a world of white people with such base level theories as well as his very limited vernacular as pertaining to any of the pseudo-intellectual things he tries to say.\u201d Ending off her thoughts, Azealia wrote that Kanye will never be the President and, in turn, Kim will never be First Lady. Her remarks are definitely harsh but, just like Kanye, she is speaking her mind on the matter. What do you think of her response?

Her opponent? Social media ne\u2019er-do-well Azealia Banks.\n\nIt all started with Ma\u2019s assertion that, prior to her coming onto the rap scene in a big way, it was \u201ctumbleweeds\u201d as far as female emcees went at the time. A comment that probably didn\u2019t sit well with a lot of people, including Banks, who fired an incendiary response.\n\nThe rapper/actress voiced the opinion that Remy Ma has had to grapple onto Nicki Minaj\u2019s in order to get her name in the headlines after being released from prison and, according to Banks, Minaj is still \u201cmiles more important\u201d than Ma. In fact, Banks went to say that the Love & Hip Hop cast member hasn\u2019t contributed \u201ca single artful thing\u201d to female rap. Unexpectedly though, Azealia seemed to reneg on her statement a little bit by changing her Instagram caption. \u201cLet me rephrase,\u201d said Banks in the reworded caption. \u201cYou absolutely must step your shit up,\u201d he added, telling that \u201cthe music you have been releasing is some serious old head rap shit [\u2026]\u201d Predictably, Remy Ma was wise to the change of heart insofar as Banks\u2019 social media statement and promptly took her to task for trying to backpedal on what she said.\n\nMa didn\u2019t waste time with her clap back. \u201cDONT F**KIN CHANGE YA CAPTION NOW!\u201d she barked. \u201cI got a year and a half more of u stalking me, hating on ya new fave, & getting ignored\u2026 I\u2019m officially airing out ALL y\u2019all chicks that was on MY line heavy when I touched down & now all of a sudden got amnesia.\u201d It\u2019s safe to say that this Instagram beef may not be fading into the background anytime soon.\n\nCheck out Remy\u2019s now deleted live dragging of Azealia in the FULL story at www.itsKenBarbie.com Who's side are you on?

It\u2019s one of the biggest and most anticipated movies to ever open in the month of February, and its trailers have electrified the Internet. Tickets have been going fast ever since presales started on Fandango late Monday.\u201d However, no concrete number has been given for this film, or any of Marvel\u2019s other cinematic endeavours.\n\nCaptain America opened to 179 million in May of 2016, and while these early projections may not materialize in such a staggering debut, Black Panther has a lot working in its favour. Firstly, the film has definitely become the most talked about release of 2018 thus far, giving it a strong word-of-mouth amongst moviegoers. Secondly, it will be released over President\u2019s Day weekend, allowing the film to rake in some extra cash throughout the holiday. Also, the original Kendrick Lamar soundtrack will also help bolster its ubiquity, while also adding to its mass appeal.

Controversial beauty YouTuber Jeffree Star is among the many who are excited about Fenty Beauty launching, he even shared that he\u2019d be attending the brands launch event.\n\nJeffree Star has apologized for racist statements that he was outed for making during his MySpace days \u2014 which included using the N-word slur, referring to someone as a \u201cpoor Mexican,\u201d and a host of other horrible remarks.\nThe problem is not everyone believes he\u2019s sorry about his past because of his questionable behavior in the present.\nIn July, he called fellow beauty Youtuber Jackie Aina an \u201cirrelevant rat\u201d on Twitter.

Will Fenty Beauty\u2019s PR take it into account?\nRihanna fans have been under her umbrella since forever.

While there are plenty of Breezy stans out there that support the R&B star in an unflinching way, there are almost as many detractors who consistently show up on social media to drag the music superstar for one reason or another. Case in point was a recent Instagram post made by Brown, where he got bent out of shape over people asking him to tag them in their own videos.\n\nIn a since-deleted upload, Breezy took some time out to clap back at all those who have surely flooded his DM\u2019s and asked for them to be properly tagged in any videos of their work that he shares on his social media platforms. According to Brown, many people have \u201cblown up,\u201d in terms of the online recognition, after he\u2019s given their material a repost, but if someone shares your work and no one is around to see or hear it because of lack of tagging, does it make an impression? \u201cGOOD MORNING.

GOD BLESS\u201d\n\nThere have been two distinct camps that the reactions to this post have fallen into: those who feel as though the complainers should be happy with Brown\u2019s willingness to repost their work and those who think the R&B sensation is being hypocritical, seeing as he probably was in a similar spot at some point in his career. Presumably because of the backlash, Brown took the post down just a few hours after he published it.\n\nDo you think Breezy was needlessly harsh here?

Her recent interview with Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show, where she kept both the host and the audience rollicking with her verbal and non-verbal responses to questions, was a prime example of her evolution from hip-hop afterthought to one of the most marketable stars in the world as 2017 comes to a close. However, while she isn\u2019t lacking in the charm department, the same can\u2019t be said for a couple of her fans.\n\nAs per TMZ, two Cardi fans got into a heated altercation outside the Rockafeller Center studios as the rapper exited the building and made her way to a car that was already waiting to whisk her away to her next stop in the Big Apple. The throng of fans that greeted her was long and swarmed Bardi as soon as she was outside, forcing her security team to take the lead and ward off many of the autograph seekers. When two women, who looked to be middle-aged, missed out on an autograph opportunity because of one\u2019s shoving of the other, things got more than a little tense.

With new music on the way in the near future, there\u2019s no doubt that the Brooklyn native is here to stay. Surely 2018 has even more success in store for the \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d songstress.

This submission comes on the heels of the rebuff handed down by the Superior Court on the issue of Meek\u2019s jailing a week ago, so there\u2019s no word on how effective, nor how quickly the case will be re-examined. However, it\u2019s a sure sign that the rapper and the team of attorneys that continue to stand behind him are not about to let this sentence fade quietly into the background.\n\nMeek Mill is currently serving the first portion of a 2-4 year jail sentence for violating his parole, a scenario he had been negotiating for 10 years. He was arrested and charged with reckless endangerment for riding a dirt bike in New York City, an incident that Brinkley took extreme issue with. There have been near-constant rumors of the judge\u2019s bias towards getting Meek locked up as well, with her attempt to supposedly get him to leave Roc Nation for another Philly-based entity being but one of the stories that the press has thrown back and forth ever since the sentence was handed down.\n\nOne thing is for certain: Meek Mill will continue to appeal the decision and, with a groundswell of support from the hip hop community, those close to him will likely continue to voice their unwavering support for his course of action.

His biggest hit also entails the repetition of \"Gucci Gang\" over and over and, let me be the first to tell you, Gucci ain't cheap. Spending over $300K on his jewelry just last month, something seemed off about what Google was reporting Lil Pump's net worth as. The search engine seemingly reported Pump's earnings over his lifetime at $150K, appearing to be inaccurate as he claimed to have signed an $8 million record deal with Warner Bros. In today's age of fake news and a search for truth, Pump called out Google for lying about his salary, letting it be known that he is worth much more than that.\n\nJetski added a video to his Instagram story, calling out Google in a way that only he could. \"Google, y'all better stop playing with me bitch. My net worth is not 150, not $150K, y'all got me fucked up, bitch. $150K? That's what I wipe my ass with, h-e.\" Clearly perturbed by the simple suggestion that anybody could think he is worth such a minimal amount of money, Pump ended off his rant by yelling, \"I'm worth $10 mil, bitch!\" Google appears to have not changed the misinformation as of now as searches for \"Lil Pump net worth\" bring up a top site that proposes the same $150K Pump was referring to.

JUST CEO Ira Laufer said donating water to the city was a obvious. \u201cThis just makes sense for us to do,\u201d she said to MLIVE, \u201cJada Smith has visited Flint and met with the mayor. Flint is very dear to her heart \u2026 After reading more about [Flint\u2019s] challenges and the mayor objecting to pulling bottled water from the schools, we thought \u2018Let\u2019s help these kids.'\u201d In February, results showed that five out of nine schools in Flint exceeded the federal water lead levels.\n\nThe father son duo launched JUST to help bring a greener alternative to plastic bottles. Their bottles come from renewable source and are 82% plant-based. Their water\u2019s comes from Glen Falls, NY and also contributes to the town\u2019s economy.

It\u2019s an unpleasant trip down memory lane, but luckily, the ad\u2019s second half is more to the point. \u201cOf course, this skullduggery alone does not make the absolute moral or legal case for impeachment,\u201d he writes, enumerating the litany of impeachable offenses the president has committed, including everything from his gross violation of nepotism laws to his handling of the far-right rally in Charlottesville to his apparent total willingness to engage in thermonuclear war.\n\nThe ad offers a toll-free number (1-800-251-2714) and email address (hustlertipline@lfp.com) for any tips., and the Post notes that it will staffed weekdays from 8:30 a.m. and 6 p.m. PT for the next two weeks. And hey\u2014it\u2019s worked before. Flynt has dropped similar ads in the past in pursuit of incriminating information on politicians, one of which reportedly spurred the resignation of Republican Congressman Bob Livingston in 1998.\n\nBut those previous offers amounted to just $1 million each.

The Aussie rapper received backlash from the Internet and the hip hop community in general for some of the things she\u2019s said and done in the past. However, all of that helped Iggy develop much thicker skin. Earlier today, an interview she did with Andy Cohen surfaced where she revealed that she burned a bunch of Nick Young\u2019s clothing after she found out he was cheating. While they may have been a while a go, it seems to be a decision she has no regrets about.\n\nIggy Azalea was caught by TMZ earlier today where they continued to ask her about her interview with Andy Cohen. Azalea was walking through LAX after the interview where she clearly didn\u2019t feel like elaborating further. She barely spoke but did let out a bit of a giggle when the cameraman asked her if anything in her bag was flammable. As she entered her vehicle, the cameraman asked Iggy if she regretted burning Young\u2019s clothes. \u201cHell the fuck no. Fuck no, I don\u2019t regret it.\u201d She said.\n\nAside from her recent headline grabbing interview, Iggy Azalea\u2019s gearing up to drop her forthcoming project. The rapper dropped off her single, \u201cSavior\u201d featuring Quavo at the beginning of February and shortly followed it with the music video.

Everyone was hype on the Biden versus Trump \u201cfight\u201d, but Schwarzenegger versus Trump would be much more entertaining. Unfortunately, it looks like Mr. Schwarzenegger is dealing with some serious health issues.\n\nAs reported by TMZ, the legendary action star underwent emergency heart surgery in Los Angeles on Thursday (March 30). The surgery took place at Cedars-Sinai hospital, and Schwarzenegger reportedly needed a catheter valve replacement. The surgery is experimental, and Schwarzenegger developed complications during the procedure. Doctors were ready for the complications though, and rushed the actor into emergency open-heart surgery. Although the catheter valve replacement procedure failed, the open heart surgery was a success. He is currently in stable condition and recovering.\n\nMany fans are worried about Schwarzenegger, who had an aortic valve replaced in 1997. Although that procedure was deemed unnecessary at the time, Schwarzenegger wanted to complete the surgery while he was still young. He also had surgery on his ribs after shattering them in a motorcycle accident in 2001.\n\nSchwarzenegger isn\u2019t going away that easily. He\u2019ll be back.

Proceeds will go towards the Keri Hilson Foundation which is said to \u201cenrich the lives of women & children through arts, education, & health & fitness.\u201d Between 2008 and roughly 2011, Keri Hilson had cemented herself as a perennial hitmaker in the industry. Her production credits included hits by R. Kelly, Mary J Blige, Ludacris, The Pussycat Dolls, Plies, and Britney Spears. Hilson profited from her own exposure as a solo artist, benefitted greatly by her work relationship with super producer Timbaland.\n\nHilson has started the bidding at $2,500. Interested fans can visit her IfOnly Page and have another 20 days to do so until the contest ends. We hope the accrued funds will make a discernible difference.

While many praised Minaj for her bringing in her trademark wordplay on the track, Ebro had a conspiracy theory of his own on why Nicki decided to deliver her rendition of \u2018Plain Jane\u2019 in the first place.\n\nAccording to the radio host, Nicki hopped on the song specifically to compete with Cardi B\u2019s \u2018No Limit\u2019 track with rapper G Eazy. ( Both records share a similar beat as well as similar lyrics structure as they sample \u201cSlob On My Knob,\u201d a 1999 song by Three 6 Mafia rapper Juicy J.) And so Ebro felt Nicki was responding to Cardi\u2019s verse on \u2018No Limit.\u2019 Per usual, after Ebro made his thoughts known, Nicki\u2019s \u201cbarbz\u201d immediately went on the attack, taking to social media attempting to school the host on the history behind Nicki\u2019s verse. Apparently, Nicki had previously asked fans which song they wanted her to hop on and most voted on A$AP\u2019s \u2018Plain Jane.\u2019 \u201cIf Ebro\u2019s ugly ass did his research, he\u2019d know that Nicki\u2019s fans had a whole hashtag movement for her to get on the song,\u201d one angry barb clarified, and many others joined in cursing out the radio host for making such an accusation towards their queen.\n\nIt is worthy to note that Nicki has clarified many times over and over that she is not beefing with Cardi B. Sadly, there is still a crop of people (especially industry figures) who are intent on putting these two women against one another.

And the internet might have been right to look at the 21-year-old with a major side eye.\n\nWe\u2019ve learned a little more about Angel Valentino-Sharpton (aka Quantasia Sharpton) and homegirl just might be a low-key scammer. Following the press conference, a friend of hers went on Facebook Live and spilt the tea.\n\nAccording to her friend, Sharpton has a history of \u201cfinessing\u201d celebrity men, including August Alsina and Kirko Bangz. Several other mutual friends of Blondell and Sharpton popped in during the 20-minute live session.\n\nThey claimed that Sharpton had previously lied about being pregnant, having cancer, and claimed a celebrity was her baby daddy. \u201cWe never saw that baby ever!\u201d exclaimed one of the friends regarding Sharpton\u2019s alleged child.\n\nThe woman of the hour, Quantasia Sharpton, also joined the chat several times. However, her poor internet connection caused several disconnects. She wasn\u2019t able to discuss her ongoing case against Usher. But she did address the other celebrities Blondell claimed she \u201cfinessed.\u201d Check that out in the FULL story.\n\nTMZ also obtained some receipts that suggest Sharpton might be scheming. A week before filing her lawsuit against Usher, she wrote on Facebook that she was in need of money.\n\nThough she is definitely sketchy, Sharpton may still have a case. She argues that her rights were violated when Usher knowingly put her health at risk without telling her about his STD status. She says she would not have given consent had she known.\n\nHowever, be on the lookout for more tea about Ms. Quantasia Sharpton/Angel Valentino/whatever the hell her name is.

Meek has been on probation for his entire life as an adult. His most recent probation violation landed him in prison for 2-4 years, although the violation was non-criminal and non-violent. A panel was held this week to discuss the injustice embedded in Philadelphia\u2019s criminal system. Meek spoke at the reform panel, from jail of course, in an event that may have jumpstarted the efforts to get the rapper out of prison.\n\nWhile news of Meek Mill\u2019s case possibly being overturned in the near future is wonderful, it does not change the fact that Meek appears to have been a victim of a corrupt and faulty system for years. It also does not change how Meek has had to invest a lot of his hard-earned money on lawyers, attorneys and the like to represent him during the dramatic unfolding of his case. Meek has coughed up an estimated $30 million in legal fees since the beginning of his history with the Philadelphia justice system. Judge Brinkley has been trying to rid herself of Meek for years, at one point stating, \u201cI don\u2019t have to deal with you ever again.\u201d Meek\u2019s management has claimed the extravagant number of expenses in an exclusive interview with Rolling Stone, which has since gone viral. For the rapper to still be in police custody after shelling out so much coin is astonishing and, especially since his arresting officer has been confirmed as a \u201ccorrupt cop,\u201d we hope everything is settled shortly.

And if you don\u2019t have the story, fall back until you do,\u201d she chastised with force in her voice. \u201cI feel like we, as black people, we have got to protect those individuals that we say are important to us, to our history and to our culture. We cannot expect other people to do that if we\u2019re not willing to do that ourselves. Pac is precious to us.\u201d Her parting words to the filmmakers were even more terse: \u201cIf you really feel like you did right by Pac, then congratulations. But if you didn\u2019t, really sit with that. \u2019Cause I hope next time, if you get another opportunity to make another movie about a legend, you\u2019ll do a different thing.\u201d Check Jada Pinkett Smith\u2019s comments about the film at www.itsKenBarbie.com "}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/f1ae280889878e438a7d0c738d72ac70/5B9D518D/t51.2885-15/e35/30078156_189378741865151_2777789280011943936_n.jpg", "tags": [], "comments": 6, "likes": 446, "date": "2018-04-08T17:39:22.000Z", "description": "\u201cWe gon\u2019 win, knock me down nine times, but I get up 10.\u201d \u270a\ud83d\udc85"}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/21e01a5771d95a055816b46b5dc20ad8/5B60F981/t51.2885-15/e35/30593672_355436271631522_687572526913552384_n.jpg", "tags": ["#HOTSHOTS", "#Coachella", "#cardi", "#cardib", "#iamcardib", "#bardi", "#bardib", "#bardigang", "#invasionofprivacy", "#bochella", "#bodakyellow", "#moneymoves", "#bloodyshoes", "#bartiercardi", "#femalerapper", "#femalerappers"], "comments": 25, "likes": 2023, "date": "2018-04-23T02:47:33.000Z", "description": "BOCHELLA QUEEN \ud83d\ude4c\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude0d "}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/be94d531db715eb32a8fbf1dd50d7001/5B993E76/t51.2885-15/e35/30591178_957248181100028_4208179364296130560_n.jpg", "tags": ["#HOT", "#NOT", "#BritneySpears", "#GlaadAwards", "#britney", "#britneyspears", "#britneyjean", "#pieceofme", "#glaad", "#itsbritneybitch"], "comments": 17, "likes": 378, "date": "2018-04-13T13:49:31.000Z", "description": "IT\u2019S BRITNEY, BITCH! \ud83d\udc40"}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/55d4719b28e0630cd785927e20906b02/5B7F2519/t51.2885-15/e35/25012154_835587713311912_4089358183519223808_n.jpg", "tags": ["#insecure", "#insecurehbo", "#amandaseales", "#jordans", "#jordan", "#passport", "#opendiscussion", "#thoughts", "#michaeljordan", "#entertainment", "#entertainmentnews", "#media", "#gossip", "#gossipblog", "#gossipblogger", "#celebrities", "#celebritynews", "#coverage", "#celebrityblogger", "#KenBarbie", "#itskenbarbie"], "comments": 25, "likes": 570, "date": "2017-10-09T21:00:31.000Z", "description": "Comedian and actress Amanda Seales ruffled a few feathers Monday morning (Oct. 9)when she took to Twitter to discuss what she defines as \u201closing.\u201d \u201cIf you\u2019re buying Jordans and Nike Suits but you don\u2019t have a PASSPORT, YOU\u2019RE LOSING,\u201d she tweeted.\n\nSeales\u2019 comments seamed to merit an amen from a few, but the rest of Twitter felt as though the Insecure actress was telling people how to spend their money.

Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Saturday stage show alone garnered 458K simultaneous viewers around the world, making her awe-inspiring presentation the most viewed Coachella performance of all time, as well as the most viewed live music festival ever on YouTube.\n\nAmidst the performance, Beyonc\u00e9 became the first black woman to ever headline Coachella in its nearly 20-year history, and she absolutely made it a point to use the platform to showcase all of the beauty of her roots throughout the entire history-making night. Making mention of the monumental moment, Beyonc\u00e9 spoke to the audience, saying, \u201cThank you Coachella for allowing me to be the first black woman to headline.\u201d She also went on to praise the women before her who paved the way.\n\nThe high octane stage show, notably a celebration of black history, black pride and higher education, was centered around the theme of historically black colleges and universities or \u201cHBCUs.\u201d Amongst many great moments, Beyonc\u00e9 performed with a 200-person HBCU marching band throughout the entire show, intertwined Nina Simone\u2019s \u201cLilac Wine,\u201d quoted Malcolm X, paid homage to Fela Kuti, and sang \u201cLift Every Voice and Sing\u201d \u2013 a song which is more notably referred to as the \u201cBlack National Anthem.\u201d In short\u2026she once again proved why she is QUEEN.\n\nIt\u2019s worth pointing out that these records may be short-lived as Beyonc\u00e9 is set to headline the Coachella stage once again during the second weekend of the music festival. Although it remains unclear whether or not her upcoming performance will be a carbon copy of last week\u2019s jaw-dropping showcase, rumors have been swirling that there could possibly be something new and even more record-shattering on the horizon\u2026 But again, this is Beyonc\u00e9.

In a new interview with Billboard, Lovato revealed that some A-list \u201cb***h\u201d was so terrible to be around that she immediately ditched fashion\u2019s biggest night and went to an AA (Alcohol\u2019s Anonymous) meeting.

It all started when Minaj posted an image of her with Lovato and Scott at the Met Gala on Instagram. The \u201cMotor Sport\u201d rapper tagged Scott, but didn\u2019t mention Demi.\n\nThe singer quickly took notice and commented on Minaj\u2019s post with a laughing emoji, peace sign, and thumbs up.

The father to Kylie Jenner\u2019s daughter is suing Richard Martinez, VIP Services, and Jorge Maldonado claiming they were all in cahoots to take Travis\u2019 money.\n\nIn documents which TMZ obtained, Travis says he wanted to buy a 2015 Lamborghini Huracan from Maldonado, who then hired Martinez and his VIP Services to broker a deal. Travis said he trusted Martinez because he claimed to have brokered numerous deals for high profile clients, including the Kardashian. But to close the deal, Travis says Martinez told him he needed to wire a $70k deposit in order to secure the Lambo. Travis did as asked, but of course the Lambo never came.\n\nThe rapper believes Maldonado was paid to bring him to Martinez so he could pull off the scam. So as a result, the Houston rapper is suing them to get his money back. It\u2019s unclear how much he\u2019s suing for, probably just to recoup his $70K, but we\u2019ll let you know if otherwise.\n\nThis story surfaces just days after the tables had turned and Travis was on the receiving end of a lawsuit this week.

There are still instances where racism can even be found in places you wouldn\u2019t think. What was it this time? Well, it was Walmart that tried it.

It is a clear violation of our policy, and has been removed, and we are investigating the seller to determine how this could have happened.\u201d Although the wig cap is manufactured and shipped by Pixnor, I can\u2019t help but wonder why there aren\u2019t things in place that would catch this type of thing before it appeared on the site.\n\nThe Internet has showed complete outrage over this product description, as expected, catch those reactions at www.itsKenBarbie.com\n\nThankfully, the color description has been changed to simply \u201cbrown,\u201d but there\u2019s still a bad taste left in many people\u2019s mouths.

The narrative will most likely shift a lot since Hedlund\u2019s character was ultimately killed in the movie\u2019s final scenes however.\n\nBut as we all know, Tyrese has been known to lie now and again. He previously came under fire for fabricating a story about Will and Jada Pinkett Smith gifting him $5 million to help with his current financial situation. He also faked a pregnancy with his wife.

Generally well-regarded by critics and a lifetime box office gross of nearly $289 million, it balanced Murphy\u2019s desire to launch himself into the role of romantic leading man while still maintaining a broad audience appeal. Now, according to The Hollywood Reporter, fans who have been waiting for a sequel to the hit film may not have to hold out too much longer.\n\nJonathan Levine, who has directed movies like Warm Bodies and 50/50 is teaming with Black-ish creator Kenya Barris to inject some new life into the sequel hopes for Coming to America 2. Levine will be taking the reigns behind the camera while Barris ia on board to rewrite the script. Paramount has had an on again-off again relationship with this franchise follow-up, but earlier this spring the studio had officially given the project the green light, with original screenwriters Barry Blaustein and David Sheffield hired to pen the first draft for the sequel. At this time, no report of a solid deal has been made public, but Eddie Murphy is said to be involved with the sequel\u2019s development and is expected to once again take on the starring role.\n\nIn the original movie, Murphy played Prince Akeem, the prince of wealthy African royalty who travels to Queens to find a woman who truly loves him instead of getting involved in an arranged marriage. Arsenio Hall co-starred as his loyal sidekick, while James Earl Jones appeared as his father.\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned credits, director Levine also directed The Wackness, as well as recent projects The Night Before and the pilot for Jim Carrey\u2019s new Showtime series I\u2019m Dying Up Here. Barris\u2019 Black-ish has become one of TV\u2019s critical darlings, carefully balancing comedy with sharp commentary about race in America today. He also was one of the writers behind the script of Girls Trip, this summer\u2019s surprise hit that crossed $100 million at the box office after completing production on a $19 million budget.

The saga that followed it was typical for any celebrity who gets accused of such a heinous act. He spoke out after the allegations surfaced and continued to maintain his innocence. He even had celebrity friends who attested to his innocence as well. Last week, reports came out that said his accuser wanted the investigation dropped. She refused to testify against the rapper in court, as well. However, that doesn\u2019t seem to be enough for the police to put a halt to the investigation.\n\nPolice are continuing their investigation on Nelly despite the fact that the alleged victim wanted the case to drop, TMZ reports. Their law enforcement sources in Washington State are saying that the Auburn PD are continuing their investigation and planning to gather all the evidence needed to bring the case to the prosecutor\u2019s office. They also report that the police in Auburn are looking to bring the case to the prosecutor within the next week. The fact that the alleged victim isn\u2019t looking to testify against Nelly doesn\u2019t make it impossible for him to be prosecuted but it does make the case more difficult to follow through with.\n\nNelly\u2019s attorney has continued to maintain his client\u2019s innocence and said that he has confidence that the case will be closed upon full review of the evidence presented in court. He continued to say, \u201cI would expect the police to do their due diligence.\u201d The way this case has been evolving over the past few weeks have been relatively strange. On Friday, the accuser\u2019s attorney told the Auburn P.D. and the King County D.A. that her client didn\u2019t want to pursue the case against Nelly. Multiple factors were considered in this decision. Her attorney said her client felt the system failed her due to the fact that she\u2019s unable to stand up against someone of Nelly\u2019s public stature as well as the fact that the police disclosed that she\u2019d already met with them to the media, which she was promised they wouldn\u2019t.

According to ETonline, the rapper is planning on suing the woman who made the false accusations against him.\n\nNelly\u2019s attorney Scott Rosenblum said in a statement Friday: \u201cThe formal close of the investigation into the false allegations made against Nelly is of course welcome \u2013 however expected. We were confident, that what our investigation revealed from the outset of this allegation would ultimately be clear and Nelly would be vindicated. A thorough investigation did show Nelly was a victim of deceitful allegation devoid of credibility. Credible evidence did show this accuser to be deceptive. We have been in constant communication with the King County authorities and welcomed and appreciated the diligence in which the authorities proceeded. Leaving no stone unturned.\u201d \u201cNelly recognizes the need for women who are victims of sexual assault of any kind to be heard and our existing systems changed [\u2026] However, this type of reckless false allegation cannot be tolerated as it is an affront to the real survivors of sexual assault,\u201d Rosenblum continued. \u201cNelly has suffered very real damage to his reputation. He has incurred economic loss and painfully has watched his family suffer. As a result Nelly is planning to proceed with litigation as the first step in restoring his reputation.\u201d The St. Louis rapper was accused back in October of raping a girl on his tour bus after a show in Washington. He\u2019s denied the the allegation right away, saying in a series of tweets, \u201cLet me say that I am beyond shocked that I have been targeted with this false allegation. I am completely innocent,\u201d adding, \u201cI am confident that once the facts are looked at, it will be very clear that I am the victim of a false allegation,\u201d and it turns out he was right.

And while the rapper has had one or two notable hits, he has also been plagued by some past legal troubles. Back in 2005, Cassidy actually stood on trial after being accused of murder, after an argument went sour and gunfire erupted between two parties.

In fact, some might wonder why he\u2019s even being arrested at all. According to TMZ, the rapper was parked in his car on Sunday afternoon, idling outside his house, when the cops came through and busted him for possession of marijuana. Police went after him after smelling a strong, presumably skunk-like odor, and made the arrest upon discovering a joint on the dashboard, a bag of weed, and a grinder. Cassidy was later booked for marijuana possession and drug paraphernalia.\n\nApparently, Cassidy had a couple of outstanding warrants from another county, for the same weed-based crimes. And while it\u2019s unclear whether or not this will even go to trial, it does beg the question of whether or not arresting somebody for marijuana possession accomplishes anything whatsoever.

Lisa Bloom, the woman\u2019s attorney, also came to her defense publicly. \u201cIt is a crime to secretly put cameras in a private place like a hotel room,\u201d Bloom said. \u201cIt is another crime to secretly record people in a private place.

And for the most part, Twitter users have been able to keep up enthusiastically.\n\nEver since West\u2019s return to Twitter after his reported breakdown and subsequent hiatus, the rapper and fashion designer has been giving his followers their fair share of motivational quotes from his philosophy book and insight into the production process behind his upcoming albums.\n\nWest has also been giving Twitter some behind-the-scenes views into his latest designs for Yeezy, his high-end clothing line in partnership with adidas. For the most part, the clothing, including sneakers, hasn\u2019t been particularly surprising.\n\nUntil.. *record scratch* the new Yeezy slides.\n\nYou\u2019re probably wondering if they are Crocs. If Kris Jenner were to respond, she\u2019d likely giggle, tell you that it\u2019s Krocs \u201cwith a K,\u201d and immediately trademark it. Either way, no they\u2019re not Crocs.\n\nThese are actually Kanye West\u2019s new Yeezy slides. Just in case you\u2019re unfamiliar (and hopefully you are), slides are essentially sandals, but are considered a bit more socially acceptable than flip flops.\n\nIn this case, though, Twitter users didn\u2019t find anything about these shoes socially acceptable. In fact, they mostly pointed out that West\u2019s designs are quite the opposite. Check out some of the best reactions in the FULL story at www.itsKenBarbie.com. Are you feeling them? HOT OR NOT?

Whether he\u2019s sharing pictures on Instagram about his hang sessions with Jennifer Lopez (who later admitted that she and the rapper were never a serious item) or sharing posts about his crushes Sarah Silverman and Aubrey Plaza, Drake is one of the kings of social media attempts at romance. Things were no different yesterday, when the Six God shared a photo that, while on the surface may seem uninteresting, raised eyebrows because of who he tagged in it.\n\nSharing a black-and-white picture of his lonesome-but-tough demeanor, Drizzy captioned the slightly sad image of him sitting next to an empty chair with \u201cStood me up.\u201d While that sounds pretty innocuous, it appears as though he tried to tag Angelina Jolie\u2019s profile in that spot as well. While Jolie neither stood him up nor decided to join him after the fact, the emcee\u2019s effort certainly is admirable. Talk about shooting your shot.\n\nTo be clear, this isn\u2019t Jolie\u2019s official Instagram account (even though it says \u201cofficial\u201d in the username), but a popular fan-made profile instead. As far as we can tell, Jolie doesn\u2019t have a verified presence on the platform but, with over 8 million followers, the fan account definitely reaches a large group of people online. As expected, fans of both the rapper and the actress were quick to react to this flirtatious move on social media. Some were applauding Drake for doing his thing and making that first move, while others were adamant that Jolie is totally out of the Champagne Papi\u2019s league.

Effectively losing several endorsements over the altercation, the actress and model is allegedly ready to defend her case at all costs to keep their current custody agreement in place. Chyna\u2019s lawyer told TMZ that the former couple still has a valid custody agreement in place over their daughter Dream and that, with Rob potentially taking measures to change the specifications of their agreement, Chyna will fight to keep custody \u201cby any means necessary.\u201d The star\u2019s legal team is confident that the court will take her side on the matter as she maintains her stance that she was simply protecting both of her children.\n\nSources say Chyna stands by her claim she was simply doing what she had to do to protect her kids \u2014 both Dream and King Cairo \u2014 in the Six Flags incident, and that doesn\u2019t think her stroller swinging should be held against her.\n\nRob is said to be livid put Chyna put Dream in harm\u2019s way and plans to take her back to family court.

As one Instagram follower said in regards to the lazy, if not dangerous labeling of plus-size, \u201cthe streets know the truth.\u201d The term plus-size was coined by the fashion elitist, and denotes \u201cotherness\u201d or not \u201cnormal.\u201d It reeks of a select ideal of what it means to be a bigger woman in this world, an ideal Riri herself surely doesn\u2019t identify with.

Blige circa mid \u201980s? Present-day Mariah Carey?

In addition, she claims that the former \u201cKing Of Comedy\u201d manipulated the court to get a gag order against Berry to stop her from moving forward on Mary\u2019s case against him. Remember, Mary filed a $60 million lawsuit against her ex claiming he \u201ctortured her\u201d and was a \u201csoul murder.\u201d Yet a judge tossed her claim out of court. \u201cThe defendant went to great lengths to make Ms. Berry\u2019s life a living hell,\u201d she wrote in her complaint.\n\nIn the end, Essie says Harvey made her fear for her life, caused her severe distress and ruined her career. She is demanding $5 million in damages for the harm she said she\u2019s suffered to her reputation, an apology and for Harvey to clear her name of claims that she was an extortionist and a co-conspirator.Only time will tell if this case gets upheld in court.

This marks her second number one on that specific chart following \u201cBodak Yellow.\u201d As of right now, \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d sits at number ten while \u201cBartier Cardi\u201d climbed two positions to number seven.

In the time since, she\u2019s been berated online over accusations of cultural misappropriation and disrespect, had her tour canceled after the online backlash, gotten engaged to and broken up with NBA guard Nick Young, and had the follow-up to her 2014 debut full length, The New Classic, pushed back more than a few times after singles like \u201cTeam\u201d and \u201cMo\u2019 Bounce\u201d failed to achieve the same level of multimedia saturation of \u201cFancy,\u201d while the music video for her collaboration with Brazilian singer Anitta, \u201cSwitch,\u201d was leaked and canceled in response.\n\nAbout the only thing that\u2019s gone right for her since The New Classic is signing a modeling contract with Wilhelmina, which has kept her visisble, but clearly isn\u2019t bringing the same level of bank that a tour would generate.

She has conquered the music world and now she may have her sights set on the NBA.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Beyonc\u00e9 is considering making a financial investment into the Houston Rockets. \u201cPop superstar Beyonce, a Houston native, is mulling an investment in the National Basketball Association\u2019s Rockets, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe Rockets declined to comment. Beyonce\u2019s publicist, Yvette Noel-Schure, didn\u2019t immediately respond to an email seeking comment. The entertainer\u2019s representatives at Sony Music Entertainment declined to comment. A spokeswoman for her husband, Jay-Z, also didn\u2019t immediately respond.\u201d \u2013 Bloomberg\n\nIf true, the superstar would have some help as husband JAY-Z previously owned a minority stake in the Brooklyn Nets before selling it off to open a sports agency overseen by the Roc Nation brand. In May, Forbes estimated her net worth at $350 million, so it\u2019s not as if she can\u2019t afford a piece of the NBA\u2019s pie.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9\u2018s last album, Lemonade (2016) was a critical and commercial success. According to the IFPI, it was 2016\u2019s best-selling album with 2.5 million copies.

Written by Michael Price (The Simpsons) and Matt Claybrooks, Lil Kev will be a series based on Hart\u2019s childhood, with voice overs coming from Kevin Hart (of course), Wanda Sykes, Keith Robertson, Gerald Johnson, and Deon Cole.\n\nThe show\u2019s premise allegedly focuses around \u201cthe story of a 12-year-old, pint-sized, optimistic, highly imaginative kid who navigates growing up in the crime filled inner-city of North Philly,\u201d Deadline reports. The series will also include appearances from \u201chis strong, quick-tempered mother, drug addicted father, pessimistic older brother, ex-con uncle, and wise-ass talking dog.\u201d Fox\u2019s new entertainment president, Michael Thorn, gave his own theory of the show\u2019s plotline and said, \u201cIt\u2019s About Kevin Hart\u2019s experiences growing up and how his relationship with his mother and his community led to his optimistic, positive outlook despite some of the challenges and circumstances that he grew up with.\u201d Thorn also added that Lil Kev was made because of Fox\u2019s desire to add new animated programming. \u201cI really want a new animated series, that\u2019s a huge priority,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a such a strong part of our brand. I think what many people think of Fox is they think of our animated shows, and it would be great to add another original animated series to go with the three series we have on right now: The Simpsons, Family Guy, and Bob\u2019s Burgers.\u201d No word yet when the animated series will air, but we\u2019ll be sure to keep you posted once we find out, along with any other information at www.itsKenBarbie.com Who\u2019s interested in seeing an animated Kevin Hart show on Fox?

The track references Blac Chyna\u2019s infamous sex tape from earlier this year, which had many confused by her lack of sexual prowess. Many clowned Chyna on social media for her seemingly below-average fellatio game, which has now made its way into a rapper\u2019s lyrics, which was to be expected if we\u2019re being honest. However, the surprising part about the situation is that Chyna\u2019s current boyfriend YBN Almighty Jay is on said track.\n\nYBN, who claims he met Blac Chyna on Christian Mingle, has a new single featuring Rich The Kid, in which Rich raps, \u201cThe pu\u2013y was worse than Chyna head.\u201d In a teaser clip of the track on Instagram, Jay appeared hyped by the lyrics about his girlfriend\u2019s subpar skills in bed. Chyna either did not hear the song yet or she is completely unfazed by it as she was seen stepping out with Jay, posting a photo of the two walking out of Saks Fifth Avenue together. Chyna has disabled the commenting feature on many of her Instagram posts so the fan reaction is unclear.\n\nYBN Almighty Jay posted a video of himself seemingly \u201cpulling up\u201d on Rich The Kid just a day after the song was released so the status of the Rich Forever teammates is cloudy for the moment. One thing is for sure, many people are starting to take notice of Jay\u2019s music because of his affiliation with Blac Chyna.\n\nTake a listen to the song at www.itsKenBarbie.com OR SWIPE TO HEAR, the Chyna reference is at the 1:47 mark if you listen to the full song.

Now, nearly fifteen years later, the animosity is clearly still present.

Amidst on-again/off-again rumors of an Oprah presidential run, it\u2019s no wonder that her name has been causing Donald Trump a little bit of caution. After Oprah moderated a round table interview on 60 Minutes, in which she spoke with Grand Rapid voters, including several Trump voters. Evidently, Trump took issue with his potential rival\u2019s interviewing style, and put Oprah on blast via Twitter. \u201cJust watched a very insecure Oprah Winfrey, who at one point I knew very well, interview a panel of people on 60 Minutes,\u201d wrote Trump. \u201cThe questions were biased and slanted, the facts incorrect. Hope Oprah runs so she can be exposed and defeated just like all of the others.\u201d Seems the Commander-In-Chief is out for blood. Still, he may very find himself facing an immovable object. Oprah is widely viewed as a national treasure of sorts, and seems to be in far better public standing than the current POTUS. To no one\u2019s surprise, his shade was immediately met with backlash of the highest order.\n\nAdmittedly, Trump is clearly not concerned with what the people on the internet have to say; after all, he is currently one of the most powerful people in the world. Still, Trump has received plenty of criticism over his inability to let things go, and perhaps his challenge may be enough to spur Oprah onto the campaign trail.

Now, another OG in the hip hop community is facing a lawsuit pertaining to sexual battery.\n\nToo $hort is reportedly facing a lawsuit by a woman for claims of sexual battery, TMZ reports. The Bay Area rapper is reportedly being sued for sexual battery, sexual harassment, gender violence, gender discrimination and false imprisonment by a woman named Teana Louis. She says the rapper had sexually abused her on various occasions from June to October of 2016 which included forced oral and vaginal sex as well as sodomy.\n\nApparently, the two met in December 2015 on terms of business and would later go on to work on music together which led to his first unwarranted advance on Louis. However, the first alleged case of assault happened in June 2016, a few months after they made a song together.\n\nIn the court documents, she says that Short threw her onto the bed before holding her down and undressing her then performed oral sex on her. However, that wasn\u2019t the end of it. She goes onto claim that the continuous abuse happened in either the hotel room or the studio they worked at together.\n\nShe also claimed Too $hort would force himself onto her. She also claims in the suit that he left her bleeding after holding her down during vaginal sex and proceeded to \u201cbrutally sodomize\u201d her.\n\nUnfortunately, this isn\u2019t the first time the rapper faced allegations like this in recent times.

While Hill explained she wasn\u2019t suggesting a boycott by Cowboys fans, even suggesting it as an option was enough to earn her a suspension considering ESPN\u2019s massive rights deal with the NFL and likely some sales deals with those sponsors.\n\nIn the days following her suspension, there were tons of people calling into question ESPN\u2019s integrity for bowing in the face of potential pressure from the NFL. Many also pointed to the network asking for Hill\u2019s voice and opinions to shine through on her show, but then getting mad when that spilled over onto Twitter.\n\nSince her suspension, Hill has been mostly silent. There have been rumors that Hill was frustrated with the network and that she might not be long for ESPN, but on Saturday she spoke with a TMZ reporter at the airport in a lengthy conversation and shut down any talk of her and ESPN not being on the same page. \u201cLook, me and ESPN are fine,\u201d Hill said. \u201cIt\u2019s just like, I know it\u2019s great conjecture to think about what might happen.

Earlier this week, a hacker hit both her and fiancee Offset with a cyber-attack, leaking snippets of a Cardi sex tape and footage of an alleged Offset affair. While the couple have since claimed to be on solid ground, their union was once again put to the test after Offset was accused of fathering an illegitimate lovechild with a notorious groupie. To be honest, this whole thing sounds pulled straight out of a soap opera, or worse, a reality show\n\nWith regards to the pregnancy scandal, both Offset and Cardi\u2019s camps denied any involvement with the potential mother-in-question, with the former claiming sheer ignorance of her existence. However, Cardi seems fed up with the noise, and during a concert last night (which also featured Migos on the bill), she proceeded to lay down the law. \u201cI let a n***a know though.

Whether or not Offset takes it seriously is still up in the air, but it\u2019s good to see Cardi standing up for herself. Despite the recent scandals, she continues to enjoy the success of \u201cBartier Cardi,\u201d which seems to be picking up where \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d left off.

Based on a report from Entertainment Tonight, the celebrity husband and wife duo are getting set to welcome the newest addition to their family into the world and, as a source close to the couple put it, their third child could be born in a matter of days.\n\nThe Wests already have two children to call their own \u2013 daughter North, who is 4, and son Saint, now 2 years old. Their third child, who is being delivered via surrogate, will be a baby girl and is expected to be born in the next few days. Though the couple\u2019s surrogate hasn\u2019t gone into labor as of this writing, a source close to the family says that could be happening at any time.\n\nKim Kardashian had difficult, high-risk pregnancies for both of her previous children, and had advised by doctors that taking on that kind of physical burden a third time could be very dangerous. As a result, she won\u2019t have to worry about recovery time or any type of medical procedures that may have been needed after the fact. According to the source in the article, \u201cshe\u2019ll be hands-on from the beginning.\u201d In terms of other details surrounding the pregnancy, the couple are remaining tight-lipped, as \u201cthe surrogate\u2019s comfort and safety is incredibly important to [Kim and Kanye],\u201d added the source.\n\nWhat do you think Kanye and Kim should name the newest addition to the family?

At first, we didn\u2019t believe it, but after seeing it for ourselves \u2026 yup, some ignant fool really did leak the episodes, and now the show has been ruined.\n\nMaking matters even worse? The quality of the leak is TERRIBLE. The episodes were recorded with a phone while being played back on a phone with a cracked screen. And, as TorrentFreak points out, at one point, the imbecile who leaked the footage turns the camera around and shows his own face:\n\nIf this whole scenario isn\u2019t crazy enough, the \u2018cammer\u2019 polishes off his virtuoso performance by turning the \u2018cam\u2019 phone around and recording his own face for several seconds. To save his embarrassment we won\u2019t publish an image here but needless to say, he is extremely easy to identify, as is his Facebook page, where the content seems to have first appeared.\n\nCheck out some of social medias reactions to the \u2018Power\u2019 leak at www.itsKenBarbie.com\nStarz and the always outspoken 50 Cent have not officially responded to the leak just yet, but their press site (mediaroom.starz.com) has been down since last night. We don\u2019t know if it was taken down by Starz or the hackers, but regardless, it\u2019s not working.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for the episodes because you just can\u2019t wait for the plot to unfold over the next three weeks, there are still some videos available on Facebook, but a lot of them have been removed, and the ones that remain will likely be taken down soon.\n\nSadly, this isn\u2019t the first time something like this has happened. Back in 2015, someone leaked FOUR Game of Thrones episodes online, and HBO responded by not sending out advanced screener copies to the media the following year. And we wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Starz does the same.

The character, named Jaybo, wears his influences on his sleeve, and has been widely praised as a successful reclamation of a hurtful past.

Carter Enterprises, plans on putting the character everywhere, on products ranging from shirts, sweaters, blankets, hats, dinnerware, mugs, shams, and more.

And while the character does have an undeniable power, it does beg the question of targeted demographics.\n\nFor some context, \u201cJaybo\u201d is essentially a remix of the 1899 character Sambo, from the controversial children\u2019s book The Story Of Little Black Sambo, which featured some seriously racist illustrations. Suffice it to say, race relations in 1899 weren\u2019t great. Despite the sordid history behind the character, it\u2019s still cool to see Jay making moves to reclaim a formerly derogatory character.

While there\u2019s no word on whether his pitch to sign new free agent Lil Pump paid off, Guwop recently took to Twitter to announce another business venture.\n\nIt appears that Gucci Mane plans on following in the footsteps of NWA, Eminem, Notorious B.I.G., and 2Pac.

In a tweet on Friday, Bloom announced that the report had been filed over the video, which she categorized as \u201cRevenge porn\u2026 a crime, almost always designed to humiliate a woman.\u201d She thanked the LAPD for their \u201cprofessionalism\u201d in the matter.\n\nBloom first spoke out in support of Chyna on Monday. \u201cRevenge porn \u2014 posting explicit images without the consent of everyone in those images \u2014 is a crime, a civil wrong, and a form of domestic abuse, she wrote on Twitter. \u201cIt\u2019s also a way to try to slut shame women for being sexual. Girls have killed themselves over revenge porn. It\u2019s not a joke.\u201d She also clarified that while Chyna did consent to the video being taken, she did not consent to its posting, which makes the leak a crime. \u201cWhether a woman knows she\u2019s being recorded is not the issue,\u201d she said. \u201cWhether she consented to posting is. Our bodies, our choice, each and every time.\u201d Earlier this week, the man in the video was identified as Mechie, a D.C. rapper and ex-boyfriend of Chyna\u2019s earlier this week when he spoke out about the leak. Mechie\u2019s reps told TMZ that have a copy of the tape and does not know how it made its way online. The report states that Mechie also plans to go to the police over the revenge porn.\n\nThis is not the first time Chyna has been the victim of revenge porn. Less than a year ago, Chyna\u2019s ex, Rob Kardashian, shared nude pictures of Chyna online without her consent. He has not faced legal consequences for his actions.

According to new reports, this may be the case as the talk show maven reportedly is accusing the queen of radio, Angie Martinez, of jacking her style.\n\nAccording to theJasmineBRAND.com, Martinez is reportedly set to enter the talk show circuit where Wendy Williams is currently flourishing as the sole face of a female-led program in daytime TV. Williams and her husband, Kevin Hunter, who also serves as her manager, allegedly learned that Martinez\u2019s talk show pilot is being shot with the same company that she does business with, Debmar-Mercury.\n\nThe site went on to add that both Williams and Hunter were taken to lunch by executives of Debmar-Mercury and she \u201cimmediately burst into tears and screamed at the two executives\u201d while her husband kept screaming, \u201cThis is some bulls**t!\u201d A source added that the ruckus could be heard all the way in the back of the restaurant and though the execs repeatedly explained that there was not a conflict of interest, the two weren\u2019t trying to hear it. Williams reportedly kept telling her team, \u201cI can\u2019t believe that b***h is getting a show with them. This is such a betrayal.\u201d Wendy Williams and Angie Martinez\u2019s beef reportedly dates back to the early 1990s when they both were the top radio hosts on New York\u2019s popular station Hot 97 FM. Martinez highlighted a bit of the tension in her autobiography, My Voice: A Memoir, recalling a moment when Williams posted a blind item to her website about Martinez\u2019s relationship with rapper Q-Tip. \u201cOne of my co-workers is dating Q-Tip from A Tribe Called Quest. Oh well. I guess some women like men who like men,\u201d she mentioned in the book of what Williams wrote on her site. \u201cEverybody was gay to Wendy,\u201d she continued. \u201cEvery rapper you could think of in that era, I had heard Wendy Williams call them gay. Not one or two. Like, every one of them.\u201d She even went on to add that she managed to confront her then-coworker about the matter and things didn\u2019t end well.

In fact, The Rock\u2019s latest Instagram workout video comes paired with some interesting motivational music \u2013 Hopsin\u2019s 2013 cut \u201cHop Is Back,\u201d which stands as one of the rapper\u2019s biggest tracks to date. In the video, the Rock can be seen finishing up an intense set, draped in heavy chains, before delivering some potential shade in the direction of his Fast 9 co-star, Tyrese. \u201cBig dogs eat,\u201d says The Rock. \u201cLittle crying puppies stay on the porch.\u201d While this could, under normal circumstances, be seen as simple \u201ctough love\u201d motivational gymspeak, it\u2019s hard to ignore the growing tension between Johnson and his Fast And The Furious co-star Tyrese Gibson. A while back, Gibson unloaded some shade in Rock\u2019s direction, seemingly over The Rock\u2019s 2019 Fast spin-off pushing back the release of Fast 9 to 2020. While The Rock is largely beloved by all walks of life and respected as one of Hollywood\u2019s most hard-working actors, the preferential treatment the studio gave to Johnson\u2019s Fast franchise clearly had Tyrese feeling some type of way. And after holding nothing back on IG, it only seems natural that an alpha male of Johnson\u2019s caliber had to get in a few shots of his own.\n\nWhile Tyrese is never once mentioned by name, The Rock\u2019s use of \u201clittle crying puppies\u201d has a far more negative connotation than his usual motivational speeches. Therefore, it seems likely that The Rock is throwing a little shade in the direction of his co-star, even after Vin Diesel waded into the situation with an olive branch in hand. However, the whole thing seems blown out of proportion, and as of now, nobody has said anything truly inflammatory. Perhaps the Rock was simply fueled by all that Hopsin in the background \u2013 after all, his subsequent post was a heartfelt homage to a sick fan.

Swae and Marliesia have been linked together since early 2017, with Ortiz sharing several photos of the two together but, with these recent allegations, it looks like the two are finished.\n\nSwae\u2019s girlfriend posted a since-deleted text photo, writing, \u201cYou love sucking people n\u2014as di\u2013s huh?\u201d and tagging Blac Chyna. She ended the post, appearing to publicly end things with Swae, saying that they can have each other. It was confirmed that Blac Chyna and YBN Almighty Jay were in a relationship but, from the looks of it, that may have been short-lived. However, the date that the incident between the Rae Sremmurd member and Chyna occurred on is unclear and it may have been before she started dating her new guy.\n\nIn the last two days, Marliesia has posted several photos to her account with captions that allude to their break-up. Swae Lee also updated his IG story with a post that may be considering their split. Check out photos of Swae and his ex during happier times below, as well as the posts alluding to their break-up.

Special character boosts are available via in-app purchases to help your character in the game.\n\nGold Ambush with Kevin Hart is the first game made by Standup Digital, a \u201ccelebrity mobile entertainment company\u201d Hart is a partner in. Hart maybe bad at this cheating thing, but one thing he is good at is making money and with Gold Ambush he might be leveling up even more.\n\nGold Ambush with Kevin Hart isn\u2019t the first game to have a celebrity pushing it, Mobile Strike has Arnold Schwarzenegger and it\u2019s raking in the dough.\n\nIn an interview with Engadget, Hart speaks on his entry into the gaming world \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of money.

The credit card fraud and identity theft charges she faced most recently are only the tip of the iceberg: earlier this year, during a routine court appearance, Karen was actually arrested on completely different charges stemming from missed car payments. And, of course, the biggest eye-opener is that she and her sons Scrap and Sas were accused of kidnapping and attempted murder\u2013and even featured on America\u2019s Most Wanted!\u2013back in 2012.\n\nBut back to those identity theft problems for a minute. As we\u2019ve reported before, last summer, Karen was arrested after allegedly ringing up thousands of dollars in charges at Saks Fifth Avenue\u2019s Atlanta location using someone else\u2019s name and credit card info. Last week, Karen\u2019s trial finally got underway\u2013and, while her lawyer technically had the case dismissed, we\u2019ve learned that Karen shouldn\u2019t celebrate her legal victory just yet.\n\nTMZ reports that Karen got off on a technicality: because of an undisclosed problem, prosecutors were unable to get the 70-year-old victim of Karen\u2019s alleged identity theft to testify in court. Because the witness was a no-show, the judge dismissed the case. (It\u2019s the second time a high-profile LHHATL star has had a case dismissed in the last few weeks.) However, the District Attorney has six months to re-file the case and restart the process\u2013and sources inside the DA\u2019s office indicate that that\u2019s exactly what they intend to do. So, if they can fix whatever problem they had with their witness, Karen might be in for a very rough time.\n\nBut that didn\u2019t stop her from keeping her head up before this trial. Karen was relentlessly positive on the way to the trial, letting her Instagram followers know exactly what was going on.

Well, that\u2019s exactly what happened when John Cena\u2019s ex-fianc\u00e9e, Nikki Bella, wanted to move into his home with him. According to the NY Daily News, this was originally seen in a 2016 episode of the wrestling reality show, Total Bellas, but it\u2019s taken on a whole new meaning in light of their recent split.\n\nThe contract itself was massive, totaling 75 pages. The contract outlined several rules required for Bella to be allowed entry into John Cena\u2019s home, the most egregious being that she would only be considered as a \u201cguest\u201d in the house.\n\nIn the contract, Cena writes, \u201c\u201cAlthough I do not wish to be formal, I do not want there to be any misunderstanding regarding your presence at the home as my guest,\u201d adding, \u201cIn the event that I ask you to vacate the home, you agree to immediately vacate the home and remove any and all items you have brought into the home as soon as possible.\u201d That\u2019s pretty harsh terms to put on someone who you intend to marry, but Cena claimed it was to protect his finances so he could continue to support his family members.

I really feel bad that the audience has to be bamboozled to believing all of this nonsense. I love my daughter, I\u2019ve always made that clear, I say it throughout the show. I\u2019ve always defended her, regardless of whatever\u2019s going on. And after this, I am done discussing my daughter. These are not clinical doctors that can do anything. [Evelyn] is a woman that is just choosing to use [the situation] for evil intent and it\u2019s just not cool. I feel like [Evelyn] will get over it once the season has ended and she\u2019s had her 15-minutes.\n\nFor her part, Evelyn continues to defend her behavior, claiming that her act of charity was straight from the heart and not a ploy for attention, check those screen caps in the FULL story.\n\nWhile normally, I think it\u2019s fine to go after Jackie and treat her like a punching bag, getting involved with her daughter and her grandbaby is beyond the pale. Reality TV can get messy but this kind of family pain and betrayal is too much to be giggling about it.\n\nSpeaking of things that aren\u2019t funny, Ta\u2019Kari decided to show off the horrific burns her son suffered earlier this year, which Evelyn donated funds for on Instagram.\n\nNow, I don\u2019t know that Ta\u2019Kari\u2019s stories about her mother are false or that her book, Lights to Her Shadow, is nothing more than a collection of fairytales, Get the FULL story at ItsKenBarbie.com "}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/43081ee453adb9ff7beb7e12a09c0c98/5B97A44B/t51.2885-15/e35/30592112_1805631499731834_2192568589721010176_n.jpg", "tags": ["#KenTaughtYa", "#carryon"], "comments": 1, "likes": 689, "date": "2018-04-16T17:47:35.000Z", "description": "Mind your business all 2018. \ud83d\udc8e "}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/ee8898c6eef9fd6a0acc6b9b096e95ab/5B80C6C7/t51.2885-15/e35/30591551_386200501861535_6677062617715965952_n.jpg", "tags": ["#HOTSHOTS", "#Beyonc", "#Coachella2018", "#beyonce", "#beychella", "#bey", "#beysus", "#beyhive", "#coachella2018", "#queenbey", "#beygood", "#yonc", "#yonce"], "comments": 3, "likes": 630, "date": "2018-04-22T17:35:56.000Z", "description": "QUEEN TINGS. \ud83d\udc1d\ud83d\udc51 "}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/b0b335fb37e1f04c3542aa3c02fbc70e/5B6A46CE/t51.2885-15/e35/26871259_1982571012063917_3579252008764309504_n.jpg", "tags": ["#jenniferlopez", "#jlo", "#jennyfromtheblock", "#worldofdance"], "comments": 12, "likes": 633, "date": "2018-01-31T04:29:50.000Z", "description": "Speaking of not aging... y\u2019all don\u2019t want a day with Jenny from the Block either! \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude0d @jlo "}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/d2bc6bb19f7042240c40a7218b5bcdd2/5B9527E6/t51.2885-15/e35/29088013_167695397218074_1937775440206757888_n.jpg", "tags": ["#BABYFEVER", "#kimkardashian", "#kimk", "#kimkardashianwest", "#kimye", "#kanyewest", "#chicagowest", "#northwest", "#saintwest", "#kkw", "#kardashian", "#kardashians", "#keepingupwiththekardashians"], "comments": 18, "likes": 1521, "date": "2018-03-19T17:36:54.000Z", "description": ""}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/9be54b44685e429a4e92d6140572c95f/5B63DB6B/t51.2885-15/e35/27893509_530887680616409_5084634893506314240_n.jpg", "tags": ["#cardi", "#cardib", "#iamcardib", "#bardi", "#bardib", "#bardigang", "#bartiercardi", "#bodakyellow", "#moneymoves", "#bloodyshoes", "#azealia", "#azealiabanks", "#kuntbrigade", "#haters", "#entertainment", "#entertainmentblog", "#entertainmentnews", "#media", "#gossip", "#gossipblog", "#celebrities", "#celebrityblogger", "#kenbarbie", "#itskenbarbie"], "comments": 20, "likes": 482, "date": "2018-02-14T19:34:32.000Z", "description": "Yikes\u2026 Azealia Banks did not hold back regarding her feelings towards Cardi B.

White reposted a video of Cardi ranting about how she feels a need to flaunt her money and belongings to remind the haters that she\u2019s made it. What happened in the comments section was unexpected though. Azealia Banks clapped back at Cardi, writing to the ATCQ member, \u201cEwww.

It\u2019s her.\u201d \u201cShe got her teeth done last year, and they\u2019re already yellow. You can take the girl out the hood, but you can\u2019t take the hood out the girl\u201d Banks continued.\n\nCardi B has obviously had a recent string of success and this could simply be a ploy for Azealia to get attention and boost exposure for her upcoming project.

Years back, it surfaced that the song originally belonged to Rihanna, but as it turns out, Tinashe had laid claim to it all along. She explained that the album\u2019s title track, written by Hit-Boy and Travis Scott, kicked off the project\u2019s inspiration, but the latter\u2019s brief romance with RiRi brought things to a halt for a minute. \u201cI remember texting [Travis Scott] like, \u2018Yo, this is my shit, I want to name my album Joyride,\u2019\u201d she explained. \u201cThen he started dating Rihanna, and he kind of iced me out.\u201d Soon after, Tinashe reveals, Rihanna purchased the track for herself. \u201cIt messed up our relationship for a while,\u201d she added of her \u201cVulnerable\u201d collaborator. \u201cI don\u2019t think I spoke to him for six months. But I guess eventually she didn\u2019t use the song, and I was like, \u2018I still want it! Can I have it back?\u2019 [\u2026] So I got it back, revamped it, took Travis off it, and now it\u2019s a new day!\u201d Back in 2016, we heard the original iteration of the \u201cJoyride\u201d with Travis Scott when it leaked online. At the time, it sparked rumors of the pending arrival of the album but\u2014spoiler alert\u2014we ended up having to wait just a little while longer.

With no confirmation by her or Scott, Jenner\u2019s silence has continues to intensify the whispers that she\u2019s well into the process of carrying a child. The couple have reportedly dropped upwards of $70,000 on items for the kid already, but even that is mere heresay at this point. However, when the paparazzi finally thought they captured a definitive look at Kylie\u2019s pregnant body, the young woman says that the contents of the pictures were in fact false.\n\nAs per E! Online, Jenner was recently photographed wearing a baggy sweatsuit out in public, supposedly trying to camouflage the fact that her midsection has grown in a noticeable way. Despite claims by the photog that the images were 100 percent real and unaltered, Kylie seems to think quite differently. In response to these photos, a separate one was uploaded to Snapchat, which featyred Jenner wearing the same outfit as she did in the paparazzi photos, showing no significant signs of a body transformation due to a pregnancy. Taken inside a convenience store with her sister Khloe Kardashian, another image of their snack purchases was shared on the social media platform as well, with the caption \u201cGirls Trip\u201d written in bold, bright letters. They may have had the munchies but, in this case, there\u2019s no guarantee that it was due to eating for two, as it were.\n\nThe rumor mill continues to spin but, if you ask the twentysomething mogul, we\u2019re still no closer to a firm answer.

However, with great power comes great responsibility, and it sounds like Cardi is beginning to realize the gravity of her newfound fame.\n\nn a new video that Cardi B shared to said Instagram profile, she began in her typically silly way, reaching for some sunnies because she thought she \u201clooked ugly.\u201d After a second, though, she got more serious, speaking about a revelation that she had recently about her fan base, specifically the younger member of that group.

In case you don\u2019t remember, Mechie was the man that Blac Chyna was making out with when Rob Kardashian went on an Instagram tirade, posting pictures of his baby mama naked and kissing other men. The incident has since been labeled as \u201crevenge porn,\u201d which is exactly what Chyna\u2019s attorney Lisa Bloom has called this most recent leak.\n\nMechie\u2019s representatives have informed TMZ that the video in question was shot in July 2017, and he allegedly is also not responsible for the leak. Mechie reports that he does not have his own individual copy of the tape, which was shot on Blac Chyna\u2019s phone, so he is unsure of how it got out. Mechie is a D.C. rapper who was with Chyna over the summer after she split with Rob Kardashian.\n\nThe rapper, like Chyna, plans to go to the police to find whoever is responsible and make sure they are prosecuted.

According to the lawsuit, Jeezy allegedly \u201cstole\u201d the entire track from one Edaz Redden, who sued Jeezy over the transgression back in 2015.

She is very bright. But it was a mistake for her and a mistake for me.\u201d Their romance was plastered all over the news, especially after Packer proposed to Carey with a $10 million engagement ring in January 2106. The two of them broke up in October of that year, and Carey sued him for $50 million for causing her distress.\n\nHowever, when asked if he had any regrets, Packer spoke out not about Carey but about ex-wife Erica Packer. \u201cIt is my biggest regret that I let my marriage to Erica fail,\u201d he said.

Michelle in regards to her health. K told fans via Instagram that the silicone in her butt spread around, causing her legs to shut down. She says since last week, she\u2019s had to have TWO blood transfusions and take medication in effort to fight infection.\n\nThough her body may be doing a bit better now, it seems K\u2019s feelings are now the subject of pain as she took to Instagram once more to lash out at her best friend (or now former?) Jonathan Hernandez, who many of you should recognize from the most recent season of \u2018Love & Hip Hop: New York,\u2019 accusing him of not being there for her during her ordeal. \u201cF*CK HIM!\u201d She began, \u201cI called and asked him to come he said he couldn\u2019t because he had to work and then said I\u2019m going to call you back, I\u2019m headed to brunch, and he never even called me back. Then today he\u2019s in my DM asking for my phone number! I\u2019m tired of being fake, because you all think we are friendship goals. I don\u2019t even talk to him anymore, he doesn\u2019t even call back!\u201d K said among other things in the lengthy comment in which she continued to label Johnathan as a \u201cfake friend.\u201d Not one to be slandered, Jonathan then hopped in the comments himself in an attempt to clear the air. He revealed he reached out to K but he had to go home to comfort his siblings whose father (his stepdad) had recently passed: \u201cThat girl is a selfish miserable person that attacks and lashes out on everyone around her. While she was crying on live for y\u2019all, I\u2019ve been here consoling my biological brother and sister who just lost their father, I didn\u2019t want to have to bring these things up but now all you guys want to give fuel to this know that I am focused on making sure my family is ok right now,\u201d Fernandez said in his also lengthy comment.\n\nIt seems as though the entire situation could be a case of miscommunication. I\u2019ve personally been around K and Johnathan together and their friendship seemed pretty genuine, so hopefully this is something they can talk about and work pass.

An arrest warrant has reportedly been issued for the reality star after she failed to appear at a hearing over a previous arrest.\n\nThe VH1 star, who is known for her aggressive behavior and getting into trouble, has been trying to turn her life around on the series. But off-screen, it appears she is struggling to make a serious change in her life.\n\nAn arrest warrant was issued after Tommie was a no-show in court, where she was expected to appear in relation to her 2016 arrest for DUI and driving without a license, according to TMZ.\n\nA day prior to her court hearing, prosecutors filed a motion to deny Tommie\u2019s bond for the case after she was also accused of attacking an employee at the Lenox Square mall in Atlanta.\n\nIn February, Tommie and a male friend reportedly visited Henri Bendel, where an employee named Daniella helped the \u201cLHHATL\u201d star. However, things quickly turned violent when Tommie began to argue with the woman. Authorities claim Tommie was caught on store cameras as she repeatedly slapped and punched the woman.\n\nDaniella told police she was left with bruises on the left side of her face and eye. Tommie turned herself in about a month after the alleged attack and was charged with misdemeanor battery.\n\nAlthough she was forced to spend the night in jail, she was released on $3,000 bond the following day and told TMZ cameras she had no part in the attack.\n\nDespite her crimes, the reality star has complied with authorities and has turned herself in on more than one occasion. If Tommie decides to turn herself in once again following her missed court hearing, there\u2019s a good chance she will be spending more than just one night in jail this time around.

Please leave it alone.\n\nAlas, my cries are unanswered once again: Deadline reports that the demons that live in this world dressed in human form are developing a \u201creimagining\u201d of Hocus Pocus, a movie that is essentially perfect and deserves no further consideration. Check out the details:\n\nDisney Channel is in early stages of development on a Hocus Pocus TV movie, a reimagining of the 1993 cult classic Walt Disney feature, which starred Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker and Kathy Najimy \u2026 The new take is being written by Scarlett Lacey (The Royals), with David Kirschner, producer on the original movie, on board to executive produce.\n\nThe 1993 film was written by Neil Cuthbert and Mick Garris, based on a story by Garris and Kirschner, and directed by Kenny Ortega. Garris hinted at a possible Hocus Pocus TV project in a recent interview.\n\nThe film was described as a \u201cnew iteration\u201d of Hocus Pocus, not a sequel or similar initiative. Entertainment Weekly touched on elements of the project that might not sit well with fans of the original \u2014 namely, an absence of the first film\u2019s stars (whose star power might command a higher price tag)\n\nIt\u2019s not that messing with the original would be an affront to its place in cult classic history\u2014we just don\u2019t need another Hocus Pocus. (Especially if it\u2019s not going to be properly done with the original cast) Hell, I\u2019d be a little bit more accepting if it wasdone as a big screen movie with an equally big and updated cast, but with Disney Channel, that certainly won\u2019t be the case. It just seems unneccessary. It was great the first time. It is fine the second time. It\u2019s a nice thing to watch with the wind whistling at your windows. Just show the children the old version and leave it at that. Are you guys here for this Disney Channel Hocus Pocus remake?

Keep finding those Tig moments of discovery, keep laughing and taking risks, and keep being \u2018the change you wish to see in the world.\u2019\u201d Still, it\u2019s a shame to see Markle leave the social media space.

Kelly have resulted in several important members of his team resigning from their positions.\n\nAccording to the BBC, the singer\u2019s attorney of four years, Linda Mensch, and his personal assistant of ten years, Diana Copeland, have both decided that they can no longer work for Kelly following the latest allegations against him. Recently, it was reported that R. Kelly allegedly drugged, restrained, and infected a 19-year-old victim with a sexually transmitted disease. Kelly was also accused of grooming a 14-year-old girl to act as one of his \u201csex pets.\u201d All of this is in addition to the allegations last year that he was leading a \u201csex cult.\u201d A BBC Three documentary, R Kelly: Sex, Girls and Videotapes was reportedly the last straw that caused Mensch and Copeland to disassociate themselves from Kelly, with Copeland confirming that she no longer worked for him.\n\nMensch defended Kelly during his sex cult allegations, but has also confirmed that she \u201cno longer represented Mr Kelly or his entities.\u201d Another insider source also confirmed to the BBC that other members of Kelly\u2019s staff were considering leaving as well.\n\nWith the Dallas Police investing the claims that Kelly infected a woman with an STD, and his longtime lawyer no longer representing him, things are starting to look bad for Kelly. While he still has yet to be charged with a crime, it appears the evidence was too much for his staff to continue working for him any longer.

However, therein lies a darkly comedic bit of poetic justice here, as Millz actually had a song by the name of \u201cSell Drugz.\u201d In light of this unfortunate development, Millz must be applauded for one thing \u2013 at least he never lied to his listeners. According to The Associated Press, Millz was sentenced to three years in federal prison for the sale of heroin and fentanyl. The thirty-year-old rapper, born Michael Persaud, was apparently busted after attempting to sell drugs to an undercover officer.\n\nThe feds were reportedly watching Millz for more than four months, during which an East Providence undercover officer bought twenty-two grams of fentanyl and two grams of heroin. After obtaining a search warrant, authorities seized nearly one and a half ounces of fentanyl from his home. While prosecutors were originally pushing for a six year sentence, a judge opted to give Millz three years hard time; Millz\u2019 lawyer later called the sentence \u201cfair and just.\u201d Strangely enough, many of the publications reporting on this story seem so enamored with the seemingly self-fulfilling prophecy they\u2019re overlooking one crucial question. Has anyone actually heard the song \u201cSell Drugz?\u201d None of the reports provided a link to the music, which led me to wonder whether such a song as \u201cSell Drugz\u201d actually existed in the first place. After doing some digging, I managed to track down the origin \u2013 a mixtape on Datpiff called Food For Thought. The song is actually available on Youtube (as seen below), but the only version was uploaded one day ago. And while Montana Millz\u2019 actually had more popular songs than \u201cSell Drugz,\u201d it seems as if the chase for a hilarious headline proved too tempting to resist.

While VH1\u2019s \u2018Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood\u2019 season 4 is well under way on our television screens, some of you may not know that the cast is still actively filming footage that we will see later on in the season. Newcomer to the franchise and reality television veteran Ray Cunningham took to Twitter last night to blast Fetty Wap\u2019s former jumpoff, fellow cast mate Alexis Sky, after she apparently called him a \u201cfaggot\u201d during an upcoming argument that will take place on the show. \u201cI normally try my best not to get in female drama, but when b*tches wanna call me out of my name & threaten to put their hands on me, YOU\u2019RE MY ISSUE NOW,\u201d Ray tweeted before continuing, \u201cCall me a faggot again b*tch, and I\u2019m going to snatch the thot out of your spirit. You disrespectful CUNT.\u201d Now, surely Alexis who has been called everything from a \u201cpass around,\u201d to a \u201cthot,\u201d to a \u201cb*tch,\u201d by the media over the last few months, should be well aware of the impact of such degrading words.

As per previous reports, Chyna alleges that Rob used an iPhone cord in a choking attempt and also tried to punch her. Meanwhile, back in September, Kardashian filed a lawsuit of his own claiming that Chyna was the one who tried to assault him while under the influence of drugs an alcohol. She also supposedly caused $100,000 worth of damage to the house they were living in at the time.\n\nRob\u2019s denial, in this instance, doesn\u2019t mean that Chyna is backing down. In fact, her legal team is ready and waiting to pounce on what they believe to be the truth in a court of law. \u201cWe are confident that we will prevail on this motion and at trial,\u201d Lisa Bloom, Chyna\u2019s attorney, told Page Six Wednesday.

She also got a few million dollars in the process. All and all, between the ring and the cash, Mariah is reportedly walking away with between $5 million and $10 million.\n\nAfter Mariah and James\u2019 breakup in October 2016, the diva demanded that he pay her $50 million. At the time, she claims he got her to move from New York to L.A., uprooting her entire life, so he could be near his kids, TMZ reported. She said he also made \u201cfinancial promises\u201d to her.\n\nOn Oct. 27, TMZ quoted a Mariah source who claimed that James did \u201csomething awful\u201d to the singer\u2019s assistant on a yacht in Greece, but didn\u2019t get specific. \u201cMariah and James had a fight in Greece, and have not seen each other since,\u201d the diva\u2019s rep told Entertainment Tonight at the time. \u201cThe fight was not because of any cheating allegations or excessive spending by Mariah.\u201d Mariah, TMZ said, was so traumatized that she had to cancel the South American leg of her tour, which also played into her $50 million request.

Rihanna had just spent the day with him the day before on Christmas, and later shared a touching video tribute in his honor. While police had been busy looking for a suspect, it appears they have now found their man.\n\nAccording to the local news outlet Barbados Today, 23-year-old Shawayne DaShawn Williams of St. Michael, Barbados was arrested and charged with the killing of Alleyne. At the time, Williams was not required to enter a plea, even though witnesses say he was showing no emotions as the charges were read to him. A number of curious onlookers gathered outside the courthouse, including two of the victim\u2019s sisters.\n\nWilliams will be held in prison until his next court appearance on January 31, 2018. As of now, there\u2019s still no details or possible motives to the senseless act, but time will hopefully unfold that.\n\nAs for what happened on that fateful day, it\u2019s believed that Rihanna\u2019s cousin, Alleyne, was walking through a track near his home at Lakes Close, Eden Lodge, St Michael, when he was approached by a man (Williams) who shot him multiple times, then fled the scene. Alleyne was rushed by a private vehicle to the state-run Queen Elizabeth Hospital where he later succumbed to his injuries & passed away. He was only 21 years young.\n\nWe\u2019ll continue to keep you posted if further information surfaces online.

Besides hanging with the likes of Alfre Woodard and Mary J. Blige, the Canadian rapper also found some time in his busy schedule to get more than a little cozy with Zoe Kravitz, an actress who was definitely open to this arrangement.\n\nAs per a video that was shared by TMZ earlier today, Drake and Kravitz were standing in an almost full-on embrace, their arms standing out against the black material for both of their outfits. They seemed to be having a grand time as well, laughing and talking with the giddiness of two compatible human beings who have reconnected by chance.\n\nAfterwards, Drizzy stepped behind the decks and was the DJ for at least part of the after party. As the clip shows, Kravitz was in full-on dance mode and never seemed to stray too far away from where the rapper was doing his mixing. Check out the video with the FULL story at www.itsKenBarbie.com\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting is that Zoe Kravitz have never admitted to dating Drake, although pictures (like the one featured for this story) pretty much confirmed their \u201cmore than friends\u201d relationship status. Then, there was her non-answer when someone asked her about dating Drake during an appearance on Watch What Happens Live. Check out that footage in the FULL story as well.\n\nDo you think Drake, the apparent hip-hop ladies man, and Zoe Kravitz make a cute couple?

While the rapper\u2019s legal team has done all they can to attempt to get their client out of prison, Meek remains locked up despite evidence of corruption in his case. A request was made for the Philly artist to be released on bail but the judge in his trial has shut him down, denying his bail. Meek has been in prison since November for violating the terms of his probation and, while the rapper\u2019s legal team has argued that Judge Brinkley has a personal vendetta against Meek, this most recent development gives them reasonable cause to continue their doubt.\n\nBrinkley reportedly did not give any reasons regarding her decision to block Meek\u2019s bail, with TMZ citing that the choice \u201ccame amidst pressure to open the prison doors for the rapper.\u201d Meek\u2019s arresting officer Reginald Graham has previously been documented on a list of \u201ccorrupt\u201d cops due to his criminal behavior and Governor Tom Wolf of Philadelphia has spoken out in support of the \u201cDreams and Nightmares\u201d rapper.\n\nMeek\u2019s lawyer, Joe Tacopina, has told TMZ, \u201cThe judge continues to stand alone in supporting Officer Reginald Graham\u2019s perjured testimony as well as his criminal behavior that has been documented.\u201d Due to their believed flaws in the judicial system, Tacopina and the rest of Meek\u2019s legal team will be appealing to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in a renewed effort to secure the rapper\u2019s release from prison.

What would follow after that news was a whole boatload of drama, including watching their marriage fall apart on their WE series, Tamar and Vince, Tamar\u2019s mother Evelyn accusing Vince more than once of physically abusing her daughter, and the singer even taking to social media to accuse her estranged husband of having a child outside of their marriage. And yet, soon after all of these incidents, the couple was seen traveling and moving about as a unit, with Vince telling media that he was working to try and keep his family together. So where do things stand now? Based on the estranged pair\u2019s visit to The View today, it\u2019s unclear.\n\nTamar sat at the desk with the hosts of the talk show and was asked to clear things up about all that had gone on with her marriage over the last few months in the public eye. As dramatic as it was, she said all of it was real. \u201cI absolutely have no reason to lie about my marriage and the things that\u2019s happening in my marriage for ratings,\u201d she said of the allegations that she\u2019s been drumming up marital drama for attention. \u201cThat\u2019s disgusting and I would never sell my soul to the devil like that. It\u2019s not that serious.\u201d From there, Tamar was asked about how they\u2019ve managed to move forward since she alleged on social media that he\u2019d impregnated another woman. Vince, sitting in the audience, was asked to come down and clear up the rumor of whether or not he had a secret child somewhere, which Tamar heard from a \u201cso-called friend.\u201d As for the future of their relationship, it\u2019s unclear what they\u2019re doing. Vince said \u201cAbsolutely!\u201d when asked if there was a chance for reconciliation for the couple while Tamar simply said, \u201cIt\u2019s ok not to know.\u201d But she did indeed file for divorce and as previously mentioned, they aren\u2019t living under the same roof.\n\nGet the FULL details and video at ItsKenBarbie.com "}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/f1beace243dbc681e6cb57d907174fa1/5B65B01F/t51.2885-15/e35/28151141_2024602197797117_7682801739187093504_n.jpg", "tags": ["#snap", "#snaps", "#snapchat", "#snapchatupdate", "#snapchatmguys", "#snapchatfilters", "#snapchatfun", "#snapchatfilter", "#entertainment", "#entertainmentblog", "#entertainmentnews", "#medi", "#gossip", "#celebrities", "#celebrityblogger", "#kenbarbie", "#itskenbarbie"], "comments": 12, "likes": 357, "date": "2018-02-21T22:15:00.000Z", "description": "Ever since Snapchat launched its redesign users worldwide went in on the social media platform with nothing but hate to the new look.

Now that we\u2019ve come so close to some sort of resolution, only to be left in the dark again, we know have to question if the whole thing was faked for the sake of storyline.\n\nIn fact, a source tells Hollywood Life, the Love & Hip Hop Atlanta stars skipped court just so they can carry on the drama into next season. They also say Kirk is even giving Jasmine money and paying her bills so that she\u2019ll go along with his plan\n\nCourt documents obtained a few weeks ago show that Jasmine was requesting over $5,000 a month in child support. Jasmine also claimed that Kirk was financially supporting her last year, until he abruptly stated denying baby Kannon.\n\nHopefully, the truth we all be revealed soon\u2026 or it may be on the next season of LHHATL.

Because of this, the judge decided that only the sheet music was to be protected, but the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals thinks otherwise and thinks sounds should be looked at also. \u201cThe majority allows the Gayes to accomplish what no one has before: copyright a musical style,\u201d Judge Jacqueline Nguyen, who is on Marvin\u2019s side, said of the case. \u201c\u201dBlurred Lines\u201d and \u201cGot to Give It Up\u201d are not objectively similar.

A rising star in the United Kingdom, Drizzy looks to be in the beginning stages of a new relationship.\n\nAccording to the publication, Drake and Raye have been on a number of dates, including a trip to his favorite restaurant in London. Initially impressed by her songwriting proficiency, Drake met up with the 20-year-old to work on music when the two reportedly clicked. The pair was first introduced after the English singer sent Drake one of her songs on Twitter, revealing she was a big fan of his. While the two have not been dating for a long time, Drake was reportedly spotted at one of her performances last week in London, furthering the rumors.\n\nWhether or not we can expect a Raye feature on Scorpion is yet to be determined but it\u2019s become increasingly clear that the two are engaged in a romantic fling.

As of right now, his ex-wife is currently seeking to place a permanent restraining order on Tyrese. She also said that he\u2019s violated the temporary restraining order after he posted several videos on social media speaking about his daughter. It\u2019s a stick situation and there\u2019s no say what he\u2019ll end up doing. The judge has yet to put Tyrese under a mental evaluation.\n\nIt was reported yesterday that Tyrese may have to end up representing himself in court after his previous attorney dropped out of the case. In addition to that, Tyrese recently blamed his psych meds for his several public meltdowns he had on social media.\n\nAlong with the issues in court, it was reported last week that he skipped out on a visitation day he had with his daughter. The singer reportedly had two chances to see his daughter but on November 9th, the day he was supposed to have with his daughter, he posted a picture on Instagram revealing that he\u2019s headed to Abu Dhabi to \u201ctake a much needed break from America and the blogs.\u201d Keep up with the story at www.itsKenBarbie.com "}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/42481149c382fe32f2d3458e4c63b99d/5B76648B/t51.2885-15/e35/28435434_179573332660815_6390968566887219200_n.jpg", "tags": ["#AngelaBassett", "#MelaninMagic", "#angelabassett"], "comments": 2, "likes": 730, "date": "2018-03-02T00:52:21.000Z", "description": "Auntie "}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/e76f5b477846259fc5f6b70ee2a0f664/5B605943/t51.2885-15/e35/25005393_275784229611707_4295986105192284160_n.jpg", "tags": ["#beysus", "#beyonce", "#beyonc", "#beyhive", "#yonce", "#yonc"], "comments": 10, "likes": 457, "date": "2017-09-11T03:37:51.000Z", "description": "My president is black... and she slays.

Not long after the single surfaced, an old clip surfaced of the artist Pardison Fontaine rapping lyrics to \u201cBe Careful\u201d over the same beat (see below). Many people thought Cardi had straight up stole the record from him, since the footage of him rapping was from a year ago, but thanks to some detective work, it turns out that isn\u2019t the case after all. In fact, it appears to be some miscommunication (mostly conjured up by Cardi haters). As pointed out, Cardi B and Pardison have worked together in the past, and Cardi even appeared in one of Fontaine\u2019s music videos, which you can see some studio sessions from (THE FULL ARTICLE OR SWIPING). In addition to that, some people on Twitter noticed that Fontaine wasn\u2019t credited on the track either, as his name doesn\u2019t appear on the list of writers; however, that\u2019s not true either.

I talk about going to therapy and sharing \u2013 one day I had a breakthrough \u2013 that I used to date mainly White women or very high-complexion Black women that looked White. I actually thought when I met Tina, my former wife, that she was white. Later I found out that she wasn\u2019t, and she was actually very much in-tune with her Blackness.\n\nI had been conditioned from childhood. Within eroticized rage, there was actual rage in me as a Black man, and I saw the White female as a way, subconsciously, of getting even or getting back. There are a lot of Black men of my era that are not aware of this thing.\u201d It actually makes quite a bit of sense, particularly when you consider the messages Knowles received from his own mother.

She was peerless when it came to her vocal chops. It was in its full power right from her first self-titled album, released in 1985. Houston\u2019s performance was on-point on all fronts, from the pop jams (\u201cSaving All My Love for You\u201d and \u201cHow Will I Know,\u201d both No. 1 songs) to the ballads (\u201cGreatest Love of All,\u201d another No. 1 jam). The hits continued through the \u201980s and \u201990s, and Houston eventually became one of the highest-selling solo artists of all-time. There was \u201cI Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me),\u201d \u201cI\u2019m Your Baby Tonight\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s Not Right, But It\u2019s Okay.\u201d Houston reached her peak in 1992 with \u201cI Will Always Love You\u201d from The Bodyguard soundtrack. The song earned Houston Record of the Year, Album of the Year and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance trophies at the 1994 Grammy Awards.\n\nSadly, Houston\u2019s success became overshadowed by drug addiction and her tumultuous marriage to Bobby Brown (they divorced in 2007). Her troubles led to tragic finality with her death on Feb. 11, 2012, when she was found in a hotel bathtub. The doctors said drowning and the \u201ceffects of atherosclerotic heart disease and cocaine use\u201d were the causes of death.\n\nHouston\u2019s musical legacy is evident in the countless artists she\u2019s inspired.

Audio footage of the 9-1-1 call, obtained by TMZ, made by one of the other employees reveals that the machine was pressed on top of his leg, arm, and head, causing a laceration to his head and serious damage to his foot and ankle. The man was trapped underneath the machine for several minutes, and it took seven people and a pallet jack in order to finally lift the printer off of him.\n\nThe paramedics who arrived deemed the injury serious enough that the man was airlifted from the building to the nearest hospital, but according to the call, he maintained consciousness throughout the incident, and he didn\u2019t sever his foot or anything else.\n\nWhile the current status of the man is unknown, it didn\u2019t appear as though any of his injuries were actually life threatening. Hopefully Adidas puts new rules in place in order to ensure that nothing like this ever happens again.

The story behind it is even better than the look, if you can believe it. According to the folks over at People Style, Michelle William\u2019 fianc\u00e9 saved 11 years for her engagement ring \u2014 even though they\u2019ve only been together for one year. Now that\u2019s dedication.\n\nAccording to Williams\u2019 Instagram post, pastor Chad Johnson proposed to her on March 21 and she said, \u201cYesssssssss\u2026..I will, I will, I will!!!\u201d The ring that solidified the deal was a whopping 5-carat rock that he had been saving up for eleven years. \u201cOn my 30 birthday, everybody came and celebrated me. The next day, I woke up alone. I was so lonely. I had a little pity party. My personal life was lacking so much, and I was living so single,\u201d Johnson told People Style. \u201cSo as a response to that moment, I opened up a ring account, and for 11 years, I put $150 into a ring account.\u201d Every month, Johnson put the $150 in a \u201cring account,\u201d not knowing whether he would use it in a year, two years, or even a decade. Apparently, it paid off \u2014 literally \u2014 because this ring is stunning, and Williams\u2019 reaction was epic. She and her fianc\u00e9 posted photos of the exact moment that Johnson popped the question on their Instagram accounts.\n\nIt\u2019s not every day that you hear about someone saving over a decade for a ring for a partner that they don\u2019t have. But Johnson said that it was a way to remind himself that his wife would someday come.\n\nIf the calculations are correct, Johnson spent roughly $20,000 on the engagement ring if he only spent the savings. According to the publication, the five carat ring was from L.A. jeweler Denis Mahgerefteh. The gorgeous, cushion shaped diamond is surrounded by tons of little diamonds as is the band of the ring. Needless to say, it was well worth the 11 year wait. Get the FULL story at www.itsKenBarbie.com...how much do you all have saved in your ring account?

Tamar took to Instagram to document her drastic transformation. She posted a video of her hair stylist buzzing her hair off, which the singer claims she did totally for herself. \u201cFinally free,\u201d she declare on March 15. The shocking video was followed by multiple posts of her new, bald look. As you may know, Tamar filed for divorce from Vincent in October 2017 after nine years of marriage, where she alluded that Herbert allegedly cheated.\n\nWendy also went for Tamar because she has been missing from her family\u2019s promo appearances for their WeTV reality show, Braxton Family Values, which is set to premiere on Thursday, March 22. \u201cShe suffers from all the girls in the family and she has the youngest [child] syndrome,\u201d Wendy declared. She went on to share a story from her radio days, where she recalled her first encounter with Tamar. \u201cI remember the first time we met Tamar, she sucked the life out of the studio.

The power couple is said to be spending around $400,000 a month for the 10-bedroom abode that sits on over six acres and has breathtaking views of the ocean. And while the Carters have been calling this villa home for the past week or so, it\u2019s actually not their permanent home.\n\nAccording to TMZ, Beyonc\u00e9 and JAY-Z have been looking to buy a place in California for several years. The couple decided a while back to move from their impressive condo in TriBeCa, New York, to raise their family on the West Coast. However, they haven\u2019t found the perfect piece of property that fits their needs.\n\nThe report indicates that the couple has about $75 million to burn, but they can\u2019t find something that works for them. Sources tell the site that Bey and Jay want something \u201cballer,\u201d but the properties that they have liked have been priced in the $150 million range. Believe it or not, even the richest people in the world have a budget, and with three children living under their roof, can you blame them? \u201cThey want a super baller, crazy estate.\u201d sources said.\n\nBefore Beyonc\u00e9 gave birth on June 12, the couple had reportedly been living in a hotel. It\u2019s unclear how long they lived in a hotel before moving to Malibu, but sources say that the family is planning to move before the fall. Blue Ivy is enrolled in a school in Los Angeles, and the drive from Malibu on a daily basis would be a nightmare.

Salling said he is \u201cpleading guilty because I am guilty of the charges.\u201d With the plea deal, Salling will serve between four and seven years in jail, avoiding what could have been a 20-year sentence and a lifetime of supervised parole. Salling will also register as a sex offender, participate in counseling and spend 20 years under supervised release, during which his Internet use will be monitored and controlled. Salling will also have to pay $50,000 to each victim who submits a restitution request, while prosecutors are asking a judge to fine Salling as well. A federal judge still has to approve Salling\u2019s plea deal.\n\nSalling was arrested in Los Angeles on December 29th, 2015 after investigators received a tip reportedly from a woman that appeared several times in the child pornography Salling had obtained. While Salling was originally released on bond, federal authorities took over the investigation after it became apparent how much illicit content the actor was in possession of. Eventually, Salling was hit with a federal indictment, to which he initially pleaded not guilty in 2016.\n\nIn all, authorities reportedly found over 50,000 images and videos of child pornography and erotica on Salling\u2019s laptop, while a thumb drive held an additional 4,000 images and 160 videos. Per federal prosecutors, some of Salling\u2019s victims were aged between three and five years old. Salling admitted to using software to hide his IP and download child pornography.

The mother of one made the rare appearance to accept the Music Icon Award at Out Magazine\u2019s OUT100 Celebration Gala. At the LGBTQ-centric event, Janet brought attention to the bullying and discrimination that wrecks society and needs to be stamped out.\n\nJanet, who is 51, looked fabulous as ever in an all-black ensemble, an elegant bodysuit with fur trimmed at the shoulders. New York\u2019s Page Six wrote that, while Janet Jackson\u2019s look stole the show and fans were delighted to see her working again, the conversation morphed into speculation and critique about her \u201cnew face,\u201d particularly her nose.\n\nThe celebrity news site charged that Janet\u2019s \u201cnose looked shockingly different,\u201d saying her face had \u201cdroopier nostrils\u201d and an \u201caltered profile,\u201d compared to other occasions where the \u201cNasty\u201d singer graced a red carpet.\n\nDr. Matthew Schulman, a plastic surgeon who is based in New York, believes Janet Jackson\u2019s nose is falling apart and is likely due to faulty work in the past or from numerous procedures that resulted in structural failure. The physician has no formal doctor-patient relationship with the singer. According to his website, the doctor \u201cis among the most sought-after plastic surgeons in the country.\u201d \u201cIt appears that there are some nasal collapse and some retraction of the nostrils.\u201d \u201cThis may be the result of multiple previous surgical procedures that have caused injury to the underlying cartilage support of the nose,\u201d Dr. Schulman said about Janet\u2019s rumored new face.\n\nGet the FULL details at www.itsKenBarbie.com As far as I\u2019m concerned, Janet has always and still does look amazing.

Oh, and did I mention she was 13 years old at the time?\n\nWell, that appearance on Dr. Phil in September of last year wasn\u2019t the last we heard from Bregoli, and she is determined to ride her 15 minutes of fame and turn them into something long-term. At first, the typical club appearances that trash reality stars from Love & Hip Hop live off of were a priority for Bregoli. But soon, she realized establishing herself as a rapper might be the path forward toward a legitimate career.\n\nWell, I will tell you this, I\u2019m not sure that Bhad Bhabie has a \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d in her quite yet, but judging by her first single and video, \u201cThese Heaux,\u201d I\u2019m sure she could at least develop her own following.\n\nSeriously, that song was not as bad as I expected it to be or as it should\u2019ve been. The production was decent and while Bregoli\u2019s voice kind of grates on the ears, her flow and conviction in her voice are there. The only problem is that she comes across as very flat or constipated in the face throughout the video. She\u2019s gonna need some serious training before they put her onstage to do any live performances.\nI\u2019m a grown man, so you won\u2019t catch me listening outside of this post, (I\u2019m also sure I\u2019m not her target audience either) but I don\u2019t knock anyone\u2019s hustle.

He\u2019s previously gone on record as saying that the controversial figure had asked Mill not only for a shout-out in a personalized song, but also allegedly tried to coerce the rapper to bolt from his Roc Nation deal and sign with a local Philly label. For these reasons, among several others, Meek\u2019s lawyer is now taking steps to have the judge removed from this case altogether.\n\nAccording to a new report from TMZ, Mill\u2019s legal counsel Joe Tacopina is aiming to get judge Genece Brinkley booted off this particular set of proceedings. Besides the fact that she acted \u201cunprofessionally\u201d in the lawyer\u2019s eyes, she is also apparently denying that she received important documents when it has since been proven that she has seen and responded to them. As a result, Tacopina is complaining to the judicial conduct board and also filing a motion for Brinkley to remove herself from Meek\u2019s case. He also said that his client is angling for a pardon from the state of Pennsylvania. That option seems like a long shot, since the process can usually take more than a year to complete.\n\nThe support for Meek Mill both in the music industry and beyond has been heard loud and clear over the past week or so, with the co-owner of the Philadelphia 76ers, Michael Rubin even writing a long letter to Brinkley, outlining the reasons why Meek should not do any time in prison.

Laura just got caught in a lie, a whole lie, and now she\u2019s defending herself.\n\nTMZ obtained audio of Helm on the phone stating she wouldn\u2019t sue because Usher always used a condom when they had sex and she wasn\u2019t worried about contracting herpes. \u201cThat\u2019s why they make protection, for people who have STDs,\u201d Laura said. It\u2019s important to note, you can still contract herpes with a condom. Contracting herpes does not require sexual intercourse. Listen to the audio in the fully story.\n\nThis conversation was allegedly on July 19, two days before Helm filed the lawsuit in which she claimed Usher did not use a condom. However, there is allegedly a reason for this big lie. According to TMZ, \u201cHer attorney, Lisa West, says Helm only lied because she thought her publicist, Dennis Byron \u2014 the guy on the phone \u2014 was trying to shop a story to the media about Usher having an affair. West says Helm \u201cdidn\u2019t want to be exploited and, in her attempt to deter Byron from doing so, she told him (inaccurately) that she never had protected sex with Usher and that she did not have herpes.\u201d The attorney is accusing Byron of extorting Helm.\n\nInteresting story, to say the least.

In the past week, news broke that he was arrested on another DUI charge in California. Rodman recently went to court where he found out the verdict on the case.\n\nDennis Rodman will be heading to rehab following his most recent DUI arrest, TMZ reports. Rodman has been sent to the Turning Point Rehabilitation Center in Paterson, New Jersey to deal with his issues with alcohol. On Sunday, Rodman was arrested in Newport, California after his reckless driving was spotted by the police. The police said that he was intoxicated when he was driving and was swerving through the roads and playing loud music.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time The Worm has gone to rehab either. Back in 2008, Rodman entered a rehav center in Florida. A year later, his family and Phil Jackson were concerned after his erratic behavior on Celebrity Apprentics which ultimate led to his appearance on Celebrity Rehab With Dr. Drew.\n\nHowever, his most recent check in came after his 2014 trip to North Korea. Rodman checked into rehab for alcohol abuse after one of the agents on the trip with him saw a heavy increase in his alcohol intake.\n\nHopefully, this will be the last time he checks into rehab.

So you had to figure it was only a matter of time before she got her acting skills on and got a movie role.\n\nThis report comes in the midst of Cardi\u2019s historic run in the music scene as her latest feature on Bruno Mars\u2019 \u201cFinesse\u201d remix just matched a chart record that was last accomplished by the King of Pop himself, Michael Jackson. In case you missed it, it\u2019s only the second time in the Billboard\u2019s history that a single has gone from No. 35 all the way to No. 3; the other act to accomplish this was Michael Jackson with his 1991 hit \u201cBlack or White.\u201d Let\u2019s not forget that Cardi is also responseble for a couple other tracks in the top 10, including Migos\u2019 \u201cMotorsports\u201d & G-Eazy\u2019s \u201cNo Limit\u201d to name a couple.\n\nWe\u2019ll continue to keep you posted on any details about Cardi\u2019s forthcoming movie role as it becomes available at www.itsKenBarbie.com. What type of role do you hope to see Cardi in?

A source reportedly told People magazine, \u201cThey started telling friends a few weeks ago\u2026 The family has known for quite some time.

Well, we\u2019ve learned the Kardashians are ready AF for motherhood, that\u2019s for sure.

As a way to combat inequality in the industry, a number of high profile actresses have reportedly brainstormed strategies and tactics to receive the money they deserve. Tracee Ellis Ross, in particular, has boldly come up with an idea to close the pay gap between her and Black-ish co-star Anthony Anderson.\n\nAs contract negotiations for Black-ish are underway, the Golden Globes winner is reportedly considering using her starring role as leverage. The star may opt to appear in fewer episodes on the hit comedy show if she is unable to earn a higher salary that reflects her contributions, according The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nThe tactic, while courageous, is a risky move, even for the award-winning actress. Some reportedly fear that it could backfire on her. A network source however, told THR that a new deal will most likely increase her compensation, but it will not be equal to Anderson\u2019s, due to the fact that his name has been tied to the series since its conception. Anderson is also an executive producer on the show.\n\nThe conversation surrounding equal pay resurged following news that Mark Wahlberg received $1.5 million for his role in All the Money in the World, while his female counterpart, Michelle Williams, was paid $625,000 for her work. Wahlberg has since donated all of his earnings to the Time\u2019s Up movement, according to CNN.\nGet the FULL story at www.itsKenBarbie.com Do you agree with Tracee's move?

Bhad Bhabie\u2019s rapid ascent to fame began after her infamous \u201cCash Me Outside\u201d one-liner went viral following her appearance on Dr. Phil back in September 2016.

There are thought to be more than 15,000 transgender Americans currently serving in the armed forces, who could now face discharge.\nIn a lengthy statement just days ago, Jenner had slammed Trump.\n\nShe claimed: \u201cFor those brave people fighting for our nation, Trump\u2019s early morning tweets must be devastating. I believe every American should be outraged by the disrespect shown to those people wearing our country\u2019s uniform.

Over the past few years, members of the girl group have spent time together and there have been whispers of a reunion, and now, it looks like it\u2019s finally happening, although it probably won\u2019t be what fans are hoping for.\n\nAccording to The Sun, all five original Spice Girls have signed \u00a310million (about $14.1 million) deals to get back together for some new projects, none of which are a tour or any new music. Instead, the group is expected to involve themselves in promoting a greatest hits album, TV shows in China, a TV talent show, and endorsement deals. It\u2019s also believed that this reunion hinges on Victoria Beckham (Posh Spice) not having to commit to a full fledged reunion schedule.\n\nThe Sun cites \u201can insider\u201d as saying, \u201cVictoria and Geri agreed it would be impossible to be part of a fully-fledged tour because of family and business commitments. Now that she\u2019s a top designer, Victoria is concerned about singing but she wants to make money to pump back into her business.\u201d Another source says, \u201cThis is the pop reunion no one thought would ever happen again. But after a long period of negotiation, Victoria agreed the time is right to work on new projects this year. It\u2019s very exciting because she has always been adamant she wouldn\u2019t go back.\u201d At the very least, Beckham posted a photo today of the group all together again and they seem happy to be there, so who knows: Maybe being around each other will inspire the Spice Girls to do actual reunion-type things.\n\nWould you be here for seeing a full Spice Girls reunion complete with a tour in music, or are you like me and just excited to see the girls doing anything together?

Jones claims that Jackson actually stole a lot of music and that he had some pretty shady business practices while in the industry. \u201cI hate to get into this publicly, but Michael stole a lot of stuff.

Noting that a portion of Tristan\u2019s issues stems from his damaged relationship with his father, Trevor said, \u201cIf Tristan was communicating with me, these problems would not happen.\u201d The father of Khloe\u2019s baby daddy threatened that he has enough information to write a tell-all story, declaring, \u201cI can write a book about what happened,\u201d later adding that the finished product would be \u201creally good and sad.\u201d Whether Trevor has unheard information about Khloe or is siding with the Kardashian family about his son\u2019s inability to remain faithful is yet to be seen.

Now, the first preview of one of her songs is available online and it\u2019s poppin\u2019 \u2013 literally.\n\nAs per TMZ, some audio of Chyna\u2019s new song hook has been uploaded online for fans or even just the curious to take a listen to. With a refrain that goes \u201cpop that p***y like a pistol, yeah,\u201d Chyna is definitely trying to latch on to the trendy trap-style vibes that have helped put artists like Kodak Black and others on the map this year. The instrumental also packs a punch, turning what could\u2019ve been a straight-up novelty song into something that should come out reasonably hard through the speakers at any club in the country. There\u2019s no word on what the song will be called or who exactly the male voice in the background of the preview clip is, but this teaser should only amp up the anticipation for Chyna\u2019s forthcoming album even more.\n\nWe'll reserve our real personal opinions until we hear an official release and full track.

Additionally, Ja has served time for tax evasion in the past, and it\u2019s looking as though he may be in trouble with Uncle Sam again.\n\nAccording to Bossip, the IRS is alleging that Ja has not paid his taxes from years 2004 to 2015, hitting him with a $400,000 tax lien. The same source is reporting that, as of today, there exists no evidence of Ja attempting to pay any of the $1.7 million he owed in 2013 for tax nonpayment. The rapper has formerly spent time in prison for tax evasion, and he may be buddying up in the pen with DMX soon if he doesn\u2019t pay up. DMX was recently sentenced to one year in prison for neglecting to pay his taxes.\n\nUncle Sam does not play around these days as many big names have fallen victim to the nonpayment of their taxes over the years. 50 Cent is definitely going to have something to say about this given their beef over the years.

The name \u201cCactus Jack\u201d was one of the many pseudonyms for wrestler Mick Foley who originated the name in dedication to his father since the 1980\u2019s. The wrestler produced several t-shirts and other merchandising with the name Cactus Jack on it. He also fought some of his most memorable matches under the moniker as well. According to PWInsider, the WWE hasn\u2019t had the name actively underneath them since 2010 and Foley retired from the company in 2012. But because they had it for so long, there\u2019s a chance they might be able to block Scott from trademarking it.\n\nInterestingly enough, as Foley\u2019s moniker was a tribute to his father and Travis Scott\u2019s father, whose name is also Jack, also shared the same nickname.\n\nDo you think Travis should be allowed to trademark the name?

The suit alleges that the \u201cFenty University\u201d line knowingly stole Freedom United\u2019s \u201cFU\u201d logo, which is featured heavily on Fenty clothing like sandals and sweaters.\n\nFreedom United sent a cease and desist letter to Fenty back in January, claiming that Rihanna knew about the logo for years before deciding to use it for her \u201cFenty University\u201d line. They also asked her to discontinue making the line, as well as a full accounting of the profits made from selling the clothes.\n\nIn March, PUMA answered back, claiming that there was no comparison between the two logos, as Rihanna\u2019s line uses a complete different font from Freedom United, not to mention that the initials \u201cFU\u201d aren\u2019t unique enough to be trademarked in the first place. PUMA also mentioned that that specific collaboration was over and no longer being produced.\n\nAccording to Freedom United, this wasn\u2019t enough of a response, and will reportedly file a lawsuit against PUMA.\n\nCheck out a comparison between the two logos at www.itsKenBarbie.com or SWIPE.

Rubin\u2019s been one of the main people who has helped facilitate several of the high profile celebrity guests he had in jail.

Safaree was a member of the Love and Hip Hop cast last season, along with JuJu, Cam\u2019ron\u2019s ex-girlfriend. Well, it appears that the two may have started a fling if Amara is to be believed.\n\nTheir relationship status was rumored for a while since cameras showed them creating a close bond on the reality show, but speculation of the two dating had not been confirmed. In defense of Safaree and JuJu, Amara looks as if she thought the news was already public, instantly backtracking after she realized that she had completely spilled the tea, saying, \u201cDid I just? Oh\u2026 Well, they\u2019re really good friends.\u201d Right, Amara, right\u2026 You\u2019ve got everyone convinced there!\n\nThe slip-up happened as the talk show hosts appeared to be talking about potential pairings. When Safaree\u2019s name was brought up, Amara chimed in by saying that Safaree was already taken by her friend, JuJu. Safaree\u2019s name has been discussed more than usual lately because of the nude photo scandal, and he looks to be taking advantage of his newfound infamy, releasing a single and making an appearance on The Breakfast Club.

After the performance, many people took to Twitter to talk about Timberlake and Prince\u2019s connection, with a lot of people saying Prince hated Justin Timberlake.\n\nIt made sense that people were upset before the performance when they heard rumors that Timberlake was going to feature a Prince hologram. Unsurprisingly, many fans were against this idea, simply because holograms are weird, but also because Prince himself made clear in a 1998 interview with Guitar World that was he was not down with holograms. \u201cThat\u2019s the most demonic thing imaginable,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything is as it is, and it should be. If I was meant to jam with Duke Ellington, we would have lived in the same age. That whole virtual reality thing\u2026 it really is demonic. And I am not a demon.\u201d So, Timberlake not using a hologram was a good call. Still, some fans had issue with the singer including Prince at all, even if it was in honor of the game being held in Prince\u2019s hometown of Minneapolis. Why? Because, supposedly, Prince and Timberlake supposedly weren\u2019t even fond of one another. But what\u2019s the real tea?\n\nWell, it all stems back to Timberlake\u2019s song \u201cSexyBack.\u201d At an Emmys party in 2006, Prince said in reference to Timberlake\u2019s single, \u201cFor whoever is claiming that they are bringing sexy back, sexy never left!\u201d It then seemed that Timberlake referenced this in his song with Timbaland and Nelly Furtado called \u201cGive It To Me\u201d.

Rocko, who originally signed Future to A1 Records, had allegedly sued the Atlanta rapper for over ten million dollars in unpaid royalties.

However, even during the lawsuit, Rocko seemed open to supporting Future, although the circumstances were no doubt tense.\n\nNow, TMZ has reported on the latest development from the near eighteen month lawsuit.

While it\u2019s unclear on whether or not he managed to secure the ten million he was asking for, apparently his lawyers have confirmed that the results were \u201cvery successful.\u201d TMZ is claiming that the settlement stands at seven figures, though no set number is given.\n\nAs of now, Future\u2019s camp has yet to issue a statement. However, there\u2019s little doubt that Hendrxx will want to put this behind him, and continue to expand on his prolific 2017 campaign. With this reportedly in the dust, there\u2019s no telling what Future might get up to next; there are no official talks of a new album, but he remains one of the game\u2019s hardest working emcees.

Nappy Boy Productions is suing Young Money, claiming that T-Pain has not received any of the promised royalties since producing and featuring on the track \u201cGot Money.\u201d Furthermore, the suit is also looking for funds since Young Fyre, one of T-pain\u2019s signees, produced \u201cHow to Hate\u201d on Tha Carter IV.\n\n2008\u2019s The Carter III sold more than 3.2 million copies in the United States alone, so the documents state that T-Pain is waiting on a big lump sum that he has yet to receive, which he estimates to be at least half a million.\n\nAs we recently reported, Lil Wayne is supposedly looking to shut down Young Money Records. Documents reveal that the issues Wayne is dealing with in regards to Cash Money and Birdman are now streaming down to his own imprint. Wayne reportedly wants the label to be dealt with properly or have it dissolved as a whole.\n\nIn documents filed by Wezzy, he is asking the courts to \u201cappoint a receiver to supervise the operations of Young Money Label joint venture or order the termination of Young Money Label joint venture and appoint a liquidator.\u201d The reports add that Lil Wayne is sick of Birdman cashing in on all his hard work.\n\nIf the Young Money label comes to an end, it will be the end of a big era. The imprint served as a stepping stool for artists such as Drake and Nicki Minaj to make their mark in the hip-hop industry.\n\nAll this Young Money/Cash Money drama stems all the way back to 2014 when Wayne alleged that his The Carter V was not being released and that his $8 million dollar advance from Birdman was not being paid out.

Fern had Twitter users doing a double take after she posted a handful of birthday selfies that some feel easily could have been posted by Nicki Minaj herself.\nIt was all fun and games with Twitter users loving the resemblance \u2014 that is, until other photos of Fern that painted a much different picture surfaced (That of which her actual skin complextion.) One Twitter user pointed out, Fern is white, which led many to wonder if her pics counts as blackface.\n\nFern insists she was \u201cnot trying to be Nicki or use her as a costume in any way,\u201d in a statement to Yahoo! News. \u201cI think the dark hair combined with my tan and other facial features that make me look kind of ambiguous? I don\u2019t know. My foundation shade has always been the same,\u201d she said.\n\nSome on social media have come to Fern\u2019s defense. What do you think?

The couple has reportedly been shopping for a surrogate for some time, but according to Us Weekly, they may have hired one already.\n\nThe outlet reports that the two chose a surrogate to carry their third child, and they may already be three months pregnant. If the rumored surrogate is already three months pregnant, then KimYe could expect their third child to arrive around January 2018.\n\nIf you recall, back in June, reports surfaced that the power couple was looking to hire a surrogate, but there was no confirmation if they had found one yet. Kim has increasingly expressed that she wants to have a bigger family, but due to previous complications with her pregnancies, it would be too risky to carry another child.\n\nSo far, Yeezy nor Kim have responded to the alleged reports, but we can expect some sort of confirmation or debunking in the near future. We wouldn\u2019t be too surprised if the couple is gearing up to have another child, and provide North and Saint with another sibling, as both the superstars have been through a lot in the last year.\n\nStay tuned for more updates on Kanye and Kim\u2019s potential baby news!

While this may not reveal anything about the project that she has been keeping a secret, her fans will be excited to see her making an unexpected, brief on-screen cameo.\n\nNews from the rapper is becoming increasingly hard to come by. A quick appearance in a brand new Mercedes-Benz commercial is the most we\u2019ve seen from Nicki in weeks, and her cameo is only seconds long. In the advertisement showcasing some of the technology Mercedes has been working on, a driver asks to play some hip-hop music, to which Nicki Minaj appears in the passenger seat, giving her a wink and bobbing her head along to the beat. After the driver pulls off a sharp turn, Nicki exclaims, \u201cYikes, you did that!\u201d Mercedes-Benz has a current partnership with Tidal, which Minaj is a co-owner of, so the pairing was likely naturally pulled off.\n\nAlthough we hope to hear some original music from the songstress soon, she may be waiting for Cardi B to drop her debut to avoid the increasing comparisons between the two.

According to a report from US Weekly, Donald Trump Jr. reportedly cheated on his wife, Vanessa, back in the day with former Danity Kane singer, Aubrey O\u2019Day. The two apparently met on the set of season 5 of the Celebrity Apprentice in 2011, where O\u2019Day was a contestant and Trump Jr. was one of the judges alongside his sister Ivanka and pops, Donald Trump. \u201cThings started up with Aubrey and Don Jr. toward the end of the taping,\u201d a source close to O\u2019Day tells the news outlet. According to multiple sources, the former Danity Kane singer and Trump\u2019s affair began at the end of 2011 and continued until March 2012. \u201cWhen it started, they were very serious all of a sudden,\u201d the source added. \u201cHe told her it was over with his wife, that they were separated and he didn\u2019t love her \u2014 all of that stuff \u2026 Aubrey fell for him hard. She thought they were going to be together for real.\u201d Then in March of 2012, Vanessa found emails between her husband and O\u2019Day, which ultimately was the reason for Trump Jr to call off the affair with O\u2019Day. The couple had three children together at the time, all of which were under the age of 10 years old too.\n\nThis report comes just a few days after Vanessa announced that she\u2019s officially divorcing Trump Jr. so it looks like all the juicy gossip is coming out now.\n\nO\u2019Day has yet comment on this report, but we\u2019ll keep you posted if she does. Are you surprised to hear this affair news or not really coming from the Trump bloodline?

Today, it was announced that the Compton rapper has been awarded one of the most prestigious prizes in the game, the Pulitzer Prize for Music, for his work on DAMN. The Pulitzer staff tweeted the news, congratulating Kendrick Lamar, Top Dawg, and Interscope for their accomplishment. It\u2019s a good look for Kendrick, who makes history as the first hip-hop artist to take home the prize. Natrually, the news has been met with celebration from most; there\u2019s no disputing that Kendrick is one of the genre\u2019s defining songwriters, and it\u2019s cool to see him being rewarded for his efforts.\n\nFor some context, the previous five winners have been Du Yun for Angel\u2019s Bone, Henry Threadgill for In for a Penny, In for a Pound, Julia Wolfe for Anthracite Fields, John Luther Adams for Become Ocean, and Caroline Shaw for Partita for 8 Voices. Kendrick certainly finds himself in some interesting company, and his work no doubt stands out from his predecessors. Still, it\u2019s a an amazing milestone for hip-hop music, and a testament to the lyrical brilliance of Kendrick Lamar.\n\nGranted, the prestigious nature of the prize is bound to invite some elitism, so expect the victory to elicit at least mild controversy. Either way, Kendrick\u2019s legacy only continues to grow. Congrats!

We reported earlier that Chyna is clearly shown in the video, performing oral sex on an unnamed man, who is notably not her ex-boyfriend Rob Kardashian. It didn\u2019t take long for her lawyers to speak up on the situation as the police attempt to find who is responsible for the leak.\n\nChyna\u2019s attorney, Lisa Bloom, tweeted out to her followers the severity of the situation, saying, \u201cRevenge porn \u2014 posting explicit images without the consent of everyone in those images \u2014 is a crime, a civil wrong, and a form of domestic abuse. It\u2019s also a way to try to slut shame women for being sexual. Girls have killed themselves over revenge porn. It\u2019s not a joke.\u201d Bloom follows up later, taking the angle that even if Chyna may have known she was being recorded that, if she did not have a say in the public sharing of the video, her consent is violated.

The arguing with people and storming off ? Kicking s\u2014, throwing s\u2014?

It was about the unresolved psychological problems that caused me pain.

The publication details that a ladder was found in the backyard of her home, where the suspects broke in through an upper floor window or door. Unlike a lot of burglaries that target the rich and famous, this particular scheme didn\u2019t lead to any of Mariah\u2019s jewellery being taken, just her purses and sunglasses. With the load equalling a whopping 50K, it\u2019s easy to assume that this could have only been around five items. There\u2019s no detail on whether Mariah\u2019s residence was left unlocked, or if the suspect had to force their way in.\n\nMariah was reportedly in New York City when the break-in took place, and although an alarm went off, security did not reach her residence until around 7AM in the morning.\n\nThe last reported celebrity that was hit by this wave of robberies was Jason Derulo just last month. The break-in was noticed by Jason\u2019s friends after they paid a visit to his crib and noticed that things weren\u2019t quite right. At the time, police could not report on how the suspects got into the home. Since Jason was on the road at the time, not much was said of which items were stolen.\n\nDrake, Kendall Jenner, Scott Disick, Nicki Minaj and Demi Lovato have been victims of the L.A. home robberies that have taken place this year. TMZ reported that these burglaries aren\u2019t because celebrities flaunt their goods for everyone to see, but because California recently opened its prison doors to deal with overcrowding, allowing the release of inmates who committed non-violent crimes. Sources revealed to the publication that many of those set free were in prison for theft, and some are going back to what they know.

The arrest stemmed from allegations that he authorized money transfers from Boosie\u2019s account while pretending to be the rapper. However, regardless of the charges that Hatch received, he may not be facing any jail time.\n\nThe District Attorney that\u2019s responsible for Hatch\u2019s case is apparently not interested in filing charges against him, TMZ reports. While the rapper\u2019s brother has emphasized his innocence throughout this whole ordeal, it seems as if the D.A is apparently siding with him. There\u2019s yet to be any reason to emerge as to why he\u2019s not interested in filing against Hatch. However, Boosie\u2019s brother has continued to maintain his innocence throughout. While that may be a factor that plays into it, they also say it may be due to the lack of evidence on the case. They\u2019ve reached out for a statement but have yet to receive one.\n\nIn mid-July, the tabloid site reported that Boosie claimed that $351K was missing out of his Capital One account. The documents they obtained said that after losing his license two years prior, someone gained access to his Capital One account and transferred large quantities of money into other accounts. It was later reported that Taquiri Hatch was booked on charges related to that incident. There were over a dozen transfers sent to different people that would later hand him over cash. The highest transfer he sent as one time is allegedly $80K. The police documents said that Taquari posed on the phone as Boosie while speaking with Capital One customer service department. However, fraud department at Capital One became alert of the situation after Taquari mentioned he had a wife while Boosie isn\u2019t married.\n\nThe situation hit Boosie very hard, as expected. He later posted a message on Instagram where he said that Taquari and his family are no longer part of their family at all. Boosie has yet to respond to the fact that his brother is essentially getting let off scot-free.

Minaj has sat on the throne as the top-selling female rapper in the game for a while now, but Cardi seems to be on the fast track to getting her own crown.\n\nHowever, don\u2019t even start to expect any rap beefs between these two women.

Wendy has been hosting one of the most successful talk shows, The Wendy Williams Show, for nearly a decade. Her name is literally in the show\u2019s title. She shut down a photographer who had asked her if, due to her diagnosis of hyperthyroidism and Graves\u2019 Disease, she would look at the possibility of a guest host during her three weeks off.

It was reported that the show would be airing re-runs during her 3-week hiatus, but Wendy has decided to go an alternate route.

A single show was briefly advertised among her tour dates: \u201cBeyonce & Jay-Z: On The Run 2,\u201d set to kick off on July 30th. While the announcement is hardly official per se, it does have fans believing that someone done goofed, and a joint tour is indeed on the horizon.

First, at New York\u2019s Power 105.1 Powerhouse, Migos took a moment during their set to bring Offset\u2019s lady love Cardi B onstage and preview their collaboration with her and Nicki Minaj entitled \u201cMotor Sport\u201d to boisterous applause from the massive crowd. Apparently, the new song will be on Culture 2, which is hopefully coming soon since it turns out Quavo actually didn\u2019t lose the hard drive with the files on it.\n\nMigos are playing a pretty important role in Cardi B and Nicki breaking a huge stigma in rap. It\u2019s been quite some time since the top female rappers in hip-hop have collaborated rather than being pitted against each other. Nicki and Cardi\u2019s willingness to work together also directly defies their own fans\u2019 expectations; when Cardi first started acquiring a tremendous buzz for \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d and racking up guest features all over the place, some fans deemed her a threat to Nicki\u2019s continued supremacy. However, it wasn\u2019t long before Cardi had laid those suspicions to rest, paving the way for \u201cMotor Sport.\u201d And just like that, \u201cMotor Sport\u201d from Migos, Nicki Minaj, and Cardi B is now available and did not disappoint one bit.

However, his official release date is reportedly set for 2022.\n\nSheree Whitfield told the Real Housewives of Atlanta viewers that she\u2019s dating a man behind bars. Apparently, Tyrone has a past with the Atlanta housewives, as NeNe Leakes has revealed that she has a past with him. She wouldn\u2019t talk about whether they had dated, but NeNe told viewers that Sheree needed to have her guard up in regards to him. It sounds like Whitfield is really excited about having him come home from prison and during Sunday\u2019s episode of the show, she said that it better happen this year.\n\nOf course, The Real Housewives of Atlanta viewers were quick to do some research to see if Sheree\u2019s wishes would come true. As it turns out, Tyrone was sentenced to 10 years in prison and he started serving his sentence in 2012. In other words, he has served about 6 years of his sentence, which means he has 4 years left. Whitfield may be disappointed when he doesn\u2019t come home this year.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that Tyrone will get an early release, but this year may be a stretch. Sheree hinted that she would love for him to come home and during Sunday\u2019s episode of the show, he hinted that he was ready to make the commitment official. One can imagine that her co-stars may be surprised to learn that they are talking about marriage, especially NeNe Leakes who has a past connection to him. It\u2019s possible Tyrone will let the world know what that connection is, as Leakes doesn\u2019t want to talk about it.\n\nWhat do you think about Sheree Whitfield waiting for a man behind bars?

The pride of the Bronx is nominated for two Grammy awards: Best Rap Performance and Best Rap Song. And like all of us, Cardi B is rooting for Cardi B to win.\n\nThe \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d rapper chatted with the Associated Press about what she\u2019s looking forward to most at the Grammys award show. Live performances by Rihanna? Jay-Z? Kesha? Nope, Cardi B is most excited about is \u201cme hopefully winning an award!\u201d Her complete honesty is so refreshing; after all, who wouldn\u2019t want to win a Grammy? \u201cThat\u2019s all I think about, to be honest. I don\u2019t think about anyone else except me.\u201d Anyone else she\u2019s rooting for? \u201cThe Migos winning,\u201d she replied, which makes sense, given that she engaged to Migos member Offset. He proposed to her last year in the middle of a live show in Philadelphia, slipping the ultimate engagement ring on her finger to the cheers of thousands. Just one of the many ways that her 2017 ruled.\n\nStill, as deserving as Cardi B is of winning awards, she faces an uphill climb in her quest for a Grammy. Women (particularly women of color) are underrepresented in the Grammys as both nominees and winners; Sesali Bowen notes that Beyonc\u00e9 herself lost out to white artists for Album of the Year no less than three times. Despite being, well, Beyonc\u00e9.\n\nWe will be rooting for Cardi B along with the rest of the world. \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d wasn\u2019t just the summer song of 2017: it was a cultural smash hit that proved that rap music could be as universally adored as any other form of music. When grandmas are bopping to \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d on the NYC subway, it\u2019s a sign that Cardi B has truly done something special.\n\nAre you rooting for Cardi?

The two seem to be getting pretty close. In video that has surfaced on social media, Chyna and the \u201cMagnolia\u201d rapper are seen riding together in a car in Los Angeles. She appears to be wearing his playboy bunny chain and she\u2019s also putting hearts on his head using the Snapchat filter. In another video, she called Carti a snack.\n\nPeople are speculating Carti\u2019s ex-girlfriend Rubi Rose has responded to news of his new relationship. She recently posted a selfie on Instagram with the cryptic caption, \u201cSis how my ass taste \u2763\ufe0f\ud83d\udc8b\ud83c\udf80.\u201d Chyna is no stranger to dating rappers having been with Tyga, with whom she has a son.

According to TMZ, sources say Chyna is working on raps based around \u201cpoetry music,\u201d as well as traditional singing.\n\nChyna is trying to do it big for her debut project and reportedly has artists like Yo Gotti, Tory Lanez, Rae Sremmurd and others on her radar.

Yesterday, the alleged victim\u2019s 10-year-old brother took the stand and testified he saw Maraj raping his sister.

According to an article published by the L.A. Times Sunday, Khalighi says she met Simmons and Ratner at a casting call when she was working as a model in 1991. At the time, Ratner was something of a protege to Simmons as he entered the world of music video directing. Khalighi claims that the two men took her to dinner in New York before inviting her to Simmons\u2019 apartment to show her a music video they were working on. When she arrived, she says Simmons made \u201caggressive sexual advances\u201d towards her, and was \u201cyanking\u201d off her clothes. When she looked to Ratner for help, she says he did not intervene: \u201cIn that moment, the realization fell on me that they were in it together.\u201d Khalighi goes on to state that Simmons attempted to force her to have intercourse, which she \u201cfought wildly.\u201d He then coerced her to perform oral sex, she says: \u201cI guess I just acquiesced.\u201d At this time, she says Ratner \u201cjust sat there and watched.\u201d When Khalighi took a shower because she felt \u201cdisgusting,\u201d Simmons penetrated her without her consent from behind, she says: \u201cIt hurt so much.\u201d Simmons has disputed Khalighi\u2019s claims in a statement published in the same L.A. Times story, as well as in a more detailed response posted to Twitter. \u201cI know Keri Claussen Khalighi and remember the weekend in 1991 that she has referenced,\u201d he wrote. \u201cEverything that happened between us 26 years ago was completely consensual and with Keri\u2019s full participation.

In this most recent development, Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner has released a list of reportedly corrupt police officers to the Philadelphia Inquirer. By doing so, Krasner has revealed that Meek\u2019s arresting officer, Reginald Graham, was among those accused of corruption. You can read the full list right here. Apparently, Graham was being investigated for several acts of corruption, and Meek\u2019s team even accused him of lying under oath.\n\nMeek\u2019s lawyer, Joe Tacopina, is optimistic that this new development will bode well for his client. In an official statement, Tacopina spoke about the \u201cDo Not Testify List\u201d, saying \u201cThe release of the so-called \u201cDo Not Testify\u201d list \u2013 which includes Meek\u2019s arresting officer, Reginald Graham \u2013 supports everything in the motions filed by Meek and others wrongfully arrested by Officer Graham for post-conviction relief. We are hopeful that this is the final step in the process to get Meek and the other defendants released on bail and to have their convictions overturned.\u201d It\u2019s never easy to say, but it feels as if this might actually lead to a win for the incarcerated rapper. Hopefully Tacopina can continue his quest for justice, and by this time next year we can be bumping some new Meek Mill. We actually spoke with Tacopina a while back, and he made reference to the then-secret list of corrupt officers.

It appears to have just been too much on one man\u2019s plate at once, something that happens often in the music biz.\n\nAs for her Remy Ma\u2019s next manager will be remains to be seen, but she\u2019s supposed to be readying a new album for 2018, so hopefully this firing doesn\u2019t delay anything.

Having chiefly to both with his custody battle for his young daughter Shayla and the physical abuse allegations that have threatened to prevent him from ever seeing her again, there was also a revelation that Tyrese floated out there rather innocently that caught the attention of public: he\u2019s almost broke.\n\nApparently, the actor/singer has been bleeding money so badly over the last little while that he\u2019s getting close to his last dime. A rumor, which turned out to be false, even had him borrowing a large sum of money from Will and Jada Smith in order to pay his legal team and other outstanding expenses from his recent court excursions. Now, TMZ has obtained documents that show the details of the situation. Tyrese may in fact be going broke, but it\u2019s not just because of his ongoing legal woes.\n\nThe gossip outlet is reporting that Tyrese\u2019s monthly income is a little over $105,000 every month. This is definitely an amount of money that should be able to sustain someone with reasonable living expenses, but the Fast & Furious star\u2019s expenditures don\u2019t necessarily fall into that category. His monthly expenses are allegedly in the neighborhood of $107,500, which puts him at a net loss of nearly $2,000. In other words, just with his living expenses versus his income, he loses more than $20,000 in a year should numbers hold steady at this rate.\n\nIn addition to all that, Tyrese also owes his attorneys $133,750. The good news is that he still has $884,658 in his bank account and owns a property worth a reported $1.7 million. Only time will tell if his financial situation will get better or worse in the near future.\n\nAnother sticking point in this ongoing saga has been the state of Tyrese\u2019s mental health.

But now, there are updates on Kylie Jenner\u2019s reported pregnancy that could help clear a few things up for her fans \u2014 as long as this new information ends up being true, of course. According to TMZ, Jenner\u2019s having a girl, and she\u2019s reportedly farther along in her pregnancy than some people may have originally thought. Like, more than halfway through.\n\nIn TMZ\u2019s latest report, the site claims that thanks to \u201csources connected directly to the couple\u201d they can confirm that Jenner is expecting a daughter with Travis Scott. An earlier report from TMZ stated that a source claimed they were having a girl, but that TMZ could not verify. Reportedly, Jenner is now five months pregnant, making her due around the same time as that sister Kim Kardashian\u2019s surrogate is reportedly due, and that Scott has been telling his friends the big news for the past two months.\n\nOf course, without Jenner or Scott actually verifying these reports, it\u2019s impossible to know which details are true and what aren\u2019t. But if TMZ\u2019s insider is right, Jenner and Kardashian are about to give birth to a pair of cousins who are almost exactly the same age. Could this family possibly get any closer? Apparently so.\n\nAnd even though Jenner and Scott haven\u2019t said anything about whether or not they\u2019re expecting a child, fans are buzzing about one of Scott Disick\u2019s most recent Instagram posts featuring the 25-year-old rapper.\n\nIn the caption of the photo \u2014 which was taken during Disick's trip to Miami over the weekend \u2014 Disick congratulates the other dude he's posing with, Dave Grutman, on the reopening of his night club, LIV. But that's not what's really interesting here. When you follow the tag over to Grutman's Instagram, you'll notice that he's reposted the photo (with a little cameo by Wendy Williams since the photo was featured on her show) with a caption that says, \"Oh Wendy just a little Dad talk.\" Of course, people are flipping out in the comments over the fact that he called the men dads.

Now, Carver County Attorney Mark Metz has announced that the long investigation into his death with be closed, with no criminal charges filed.\n\nPrince was found dead in the elevator at Paisley Park Studios in Chanhassan, Minnesota. It was later discovered that the singer\u2019s death was due to fentanyl painkillers, which were disguised as Vicodin pills. An autopsy found 67 micrograms of fentanyl per liter in Prince\u2019s bloodstream, more than enough to act as a fatal dose to any human being.\n\nAccording to StarTribune, Metz stated that the investigators conducted a \u201cextensive, painstaking and thorough\u201d investigation into the matter, but they were unable to produce any conclusive evidence as to who sold Prince the counterfeit medication. \u201cThere is no reliable evidence showing how Prince obtained the counterfeit Vicodin containing fentanyl,\u201d said Metz. \u201cThe bottom line is that we simply do not have sufficient evidence to charge anyone with a crime related to Prince\u2019s death.\u201d The U.S. Attorney\u2019s office in Minnesota also confirmed that they had agreed to a settlement with Prince\u2019s doctor, who filed painkiller perscriptions for Prince\u2019s bodyguard, Kirk Johnson, with the full knowledge that the pills were actually for Prince himself. The doctor will have to pay a $30,000 fine, and will be under investigation by the DEA for two years. He is currently not under investigation for giving Prince the fentanyl pills.\n\nUnless new evidence or an unknown witness comes forward, the mystery as to who sold Prince the drugs will go unsolved.

This time around, she\u2019s come armed with fiery imagery and putdowns for everyone who is sick and tired of Taylor Swift and her games.\n\nFirst off, she comes for Kanye and her disgust of his \u201ctilted stage.\u201d She doesn\u2019t cast a Kanye-lookalike in the video, but in the end she does play herself as the doe-eyed young girl onstage at the VMAs holding the moon man that night.\n\nThe video is also full of snake imagery, which Kim Kardashian branded Taylor with when she memorably \u201cexposed\u201d Taylor\u2019s lies by playing a phone conversation between Swift and her hubby, in which Taylor gave her blessing for the mention of her on his controversial track, \u201cFamous.\u201d Much of the video looks and feels like diet Beyonc\u00e9, with Taylor strutting and posing like the Queen Bey, but lacking any of the actual talent and dance skills to pull it off. But I\u2019ll give her credit, the make-up artist, wardrobe designer, and production put in work for this video.\n\nI\u2019m not sure I got the dominatrix outfit and scene though. It lent an aggressively sexual undertone that didn\u2019t ladder up to anything more significant.\n\nAs for her most prominent female foe, Taylor dons a cat mask and wears a Tiger shirt (hello, \u201cRoar\u201d) as she smashes things with a bat. The sad thing is, Katy Perry has tapped out of this beef and softened her stance already by turning her \u201cSwish Swish\u201d Swift diss track into something pathetically stupid, so all of this fire from Taylor directed at Katy is wasted energy anyway.\n\nThe end of the video finds the many versions of Taylor throughout her career justifying and mimicking many of the complaints people have about her celebrity persona, including the most prominent one about her always playing the victim or acting surprised.\n\nWatch Taylor Swift pout, pose and snarl in her \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d video at www.itsKenBarbie.com "}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/2667615eafe49a7e32a6a30496cb2bca/5B7F7E8A/t51.2885-15/e35/30591064_407431946335029_6125210705168695296_n.jpg", "tags": ["#haddish", "#tiffanyhaddish", "#girlstrip", "#sheready", "#thelastblackunicorn", "#entertainment", "#entertainmentblog", "#gossip", "#actyourwage", "#celebrities", "#celebrityblogger", "#kenbarbie", "#itskenbarbie"], "comments": 25, "likes": 1334, "date": "2018-04-22T01:06:29.000Z", "description": "Tiffany Haddish has got the last laugh as one of the biggest stars of the past year and she\u2019s keeping that momentum going by landing the cover of W Magazine\u2019s \u201cDare To Be You\u201d issue.\n\nHaddish is doing her all the way and makes a splash on the W cover in a bold red gown and spills all the tea inside its pages dishing about her life from being in foster care to being homeless to rising as a superstar. \u201cWhen I was shooting Girls Trip \u2026 I had a knockoff Michael Kors bag that said MLK instead of MK.

I do not want a bag that is more expensive than the cash I have to put in it.\u201d Tiffany Haddish is sensitive about her money, given her rocky history with it.

The clip is heavy on the religious imagery, taking place in a chapel and employing some heavily Catholic visual themes.

She is a priestess: she hears Jay-Z\u2019s confession, apparently a statement on his real-life infidelities.\n\nIs it anti-Catholic? No, it is not a bigoted assault. Indeed, it pales next to Jay-Z\u2019s relentlessly racist (and anti-black) lyrics.

However, the fruits of her labor are not just paying off for herself but for others that surround her as well.

She got a Bentley and teeth that are priced in the near range.\n\nDr. Catrise Austin\u2019s clientele include other major celebrities. Along with Cardi B, DJ Khaled, Busta Rhymes, Common, Toni Braxton and Omarosa are Austin\u2019s clients. However, Austin says that the demand for her business is not limited to celebrities.

Rick Ross has reportedly been put on a form of life support. According to TMZ, the recently hospitalized rapper has been hook up to a machine designed to help with breathing; essentially taking over the functions of both his heart and lungs. While details remain cloudy, it\u2019s certainly looking bleak for the iconic Boss. Apparently, Ross has been in a Miami hospital, being treated in the cardiovascular unit. While initial diagnosis pointed to pneumonia, it has been speculated that Ross suffered a heart attack. Again, details remain unclear.\n\nTMZ claims that Ross has been put on something called ECMO, an acronym for extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation. The process pumps oxygen into his blood from outside his body, and then proceeds to recirculate the oxygenated blood. While it\u2019s no doubt more complicated than that, it seems like Rick Ross is in a serious condition right now. All we can do right now is pray for the Boss to pull through. The legendary rapper is only forty-two, and this recent health scare is certainly causing fear to spread within his fanbase.\n\nHopefully Rick Ross can rally. The game still needs him.

Cardi is coming off the release of \"Bartier Cardi\" and the Bruno Mars assisted \"Finesse Remix,\" which are currently solidifying her as a bonafide radio star; her breakout single \"Bodak Yellow\" is nominated for \"Best Rap Song\" and \"Best Rap Performance.\" Logic's \"1800-273-8255\" may possess the least-spoken song title of all time, but it also proved to be the rapper's biggest hit of his career; it's nominated for \"Song Of The Year\" and \"Best Music Video.\" SZA is also proving herself as one of rnb's most talented artists, with CTRL making many best of 2017 lists, as well as landing nominations for \"Best New Artist,\" \"Best R&B Performance (\"The Weekend\")\", \"Best R&B Song\" (\"Supermodel\"), \"Best Urban Contemporary Album\" (Ctrl), and \"Best Rap/Sung Performance\" (\"Love Galore\").

The alleged assault reportedly took place the same day that Mystikal was in Shreveport on his Southern Hip-Hop Tour.\n\nMystikal previously served 6 years in prison after he pleaded guilty to sexual battery in 2003.

The singer\u2019s public life has pretty much been on display for everyone to watch and he\u2019s been obviously struggling with his mental health and everything that\u2019s been thrown his way lately. A few days back, his ex-wife not only requested he undergo a mental evaluation but also wanted a restraining order against him. Today, it looks like things are working more in his favor than hers.\n\nTyrese has just won his way through the court. The judge has granted him 50/50 custody of his daughter, Shayla, according to TMZ\u2019s report. This comes a few days after his ex-wife, Norma Gibson, requested a restraining order but the judge denied her that. However, the joint custody will begin in January and until then, the two of them will have to arrange a visitation schedule so Tyrese could spend time with his daughter throughout the holidays.\n\nTyrese also took to Instagram to share his own thoughts on what happened. The entertainer expressed relief for what\u2019s been his life for the past 80+ days. Along with that, he also called on Michael Moore, Netflix and Tim Cooke of Apple for a potential movie on the series of events that have occurred. \u201cI got over 400 hours of logged and captured footage this will be bigger than Avatar cause \u201cFathers\u201d and the lack of support in the courts is a universal issue,\u201d he wrote.

NoRMA ask yourself since you hate SO much why are you still holding onto my last name???? You\u2019re NOT a Gibson your name is NORMA MITCHELL \u2013 There are only 3 real Gibson\u2019s from my side\u2026. Shayla Gibson, TYRESE Gibson and my real wife Samantha Lee Gibson \u2013 period.\u201d So it looks like things are a bit more copacetic for Tyrese and he\u2019ll be able to finally be with his daughter again.

According to TMZ, Riri just sold her West Hollywood home for $2.85 million dollars last week.\n\nThe home, which has been on the market for the past five months, was purchased back in August of last year for $2.75 million, meaning she just made a cool $100K profit in about 7 months time for doing absolutely nothing. At first, the home didn\u2019t have any takers, despite all the amenities it has and the fact Rihanna owns it, but luckily it sold at asking price last week. Rihanna only had the home for 3 months before she decided to have a change of heart and put it up for sale, but it worked out.\n\nThe home itself was a 2,800 square foot pad that had 4 bedroom, 4 bathrooms, a pool, and its own guesthouse. However it wasn\u2019t where she lived. In fact, Rihanna has anther Hollywood mansion that she bought last year for $6.8 million that is really poppin\u2019. It\u2019s reported that that\u2019s a sleek, 7,130-square-foot mansion with 6 bedrooms, ten bathrooms, infinity pool, movie theatre and spa, among other cool features.\n\nThe news of her selling the crib couldn\u2019t come at a better time for her either as it was just announced that Rihanna is starting hero own lingerie line. She also has her Fenty x Puma collab dropping March 15 as well, so it\u2019s safe to say she\u2019s going to keep stacking that paper.

Following her impeccable speech at Sunday\u2019s Golden Globes ceremony where she hinted at a \u201cnew day\u201d being just around the corner, rumors have been running rampant that the TV magnate is actively considering a Presidential run, one that might lead to her squaring off against Donald Trump. However, her best gal pal Gayle King isn\u2019t ready to print those campaign posters just yet.\n\nIn an appearance on CBS This Morning, King denied the speculation that Oprah is actively considering running for office, although she did admit that the mogul is \u201cintrigued\u201d by the idea. \u201cShe loves this country and would like to be of service in some way,\u201d she added. However, when asked about Stedman Graham\u2019s comments that added even more fuel to the \u201cOprah for President\u201d fire, that\u2019s where things got a little strange. \u201cStedman says that he thought the reporter said to him \u2018Would she make a good president?'\u201d King said. \u201cAnd he said \u2018Absolutely she would.\u2019 That\u2019s how he interpreted the question, because this is the thing \u2013 Stedman would never so cavalierly say absolutely she would do it. It\u2019s up to the people. He would never do that.\u201d However, that\u2019s not really what happened.

We are your sass, your nonchalance, your fury, your delight, your annoyance, your happy dance, your diva, your shade, your \u2018yaas\u2019 moments. The weight of reaction GIFing, period, rests on our shoulders. Intertwine this proliferation of our images with the other ones we\u2019re as likely to see \u2014 death, looped over and over \u2014 and the Internet becomes an exhausting experience,\u201d she writes. \u201cIf you find yourself always reaching for a black face to release your inner sass monster, maybe consider going the extra country mile and pick this nice Taylor Swift GIF instead.\u201d However, Bre Payton of The Federalist disagrees: \u201cAccusing someone of making fun of African-Americans by donning blackface is a serious thing indeed, which is why throwing that term around casually is problematic. When people share a GIF of a black person, they are not painting themselves with blackface makeup to perpetuate a stereotype or bar people entry from theater or even public life. Often they are not even stereotyping, given that posting GIFs is by nature an expression of shared humanity.\u201d What do you think? Is the Teen Vogue article right, or is it a stretch?

Sometimes it ends in court battle, sometimes it ends in settlements and bitter breakups; now, that group of people supposed to be the perpetrators of such acts includes the name of Mike Epps, who is being accused of lifting the idea of a TV show that he recently got greenlit from three other producers.\n\nAccording to TMZ, Calvin Valrie, LaMichael Finney and Bervick J. Deculus have combined and, using their respective lawyers, sent a cease and desist letter to Epps\u2019 reps, claiming the show Mike\u2019s currently executive producing called Social Awards, is very similar to a show that they previously pitched to Epp\u2019s cousin called Social Media Wars. Apparently, the producers never heard back from Epps and \u201cwere blindsided\u201d when the news broke a few weeks ago that BET would be airing Epps\u2019 version of the program next year.\n\nThe three men are reportedly still willing to work with Epps, but they wanted to sell the show to FOX instead. The producers have handed down an ultimatum, as per their legal docs: cooperate by the end of the week, or else. It doesn\u2019t sound like Epps will be undoing his deal with BET in that short a time frame, meaning that this is a battle that could get testy rather quickly.

Most recently, she fired shots at Charlamagne tha God and Jermaine Dupri for fat-shaming.\n\nQuantasia Sharpton dropped off a lengthy Instagram caption under a snippet of Jermaine Dupri\u2019s recent interview on the Breakfast Club where he chimed in on Usher\u2019s whole scenario with Quantasia. Dupri said that because of Sharpton\u2019s weight, it\u2019s highly unlikely that Usher was involved in any sort of sexual activity with her. He also mentioned that Usher\u2019s also denied this happened in conversations with him. Well, Sharpton hit Instagram with a lengthy response to Dupri and Charlamagne\u2019s fat-shaming comments. \u201cOkay so this will be the last time that I address any of this shit cause quite frankly I\u2019m tired of it.

Some reports said she had forgiven him for reportedly cheating on her while she was pregnant with their daughter and was trying to focus on the baby, but this new update on Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian and Tristan Thompson\u2019s relationship says things are much worse between the two than they\u2019re letting on. TMZ reports that the only reason Kardashian is still in Thompson\u2019s house in Cleveland is because she hasn\u2019t been medically cleared to fly yet. (She\u2019ll likely have to wait a little longer to fly with True as well.) The second she can, however, she\u2019s reportedly taking True back with her to L.A.\n\nKardashian\u2019s family has reportedly been ensuring that they\u2019re never in a room alone together by having Kris Jenner stay there with Kardashian and the baby. Kim and Kourtney Kardashian and Kendall Jenner also arrived in Cleveland on April 16 for the second time since Khlo\u00e9 gave birth, so it looks like the Kardashian Kavalry has come in to help out Khlo\u00e9 and True.\n\nWhile Kardashian\u2019s birth announcement on Instagram didn\u2019t hint at any bad blood between her and the father of her child. A source reportedly told TMZ that this is far from the truth \u2014 Kardashian hasn\u2019t spoken to Thompson in days. They said, \u201cKhlo\u00e9 has not spoken to Tristan for several days because she\u2019s still furious after finding out he repeatedly cheated on her, and embarrassed her in the process.\u201d This contradicts the narrative being told to many sources that Kardashian reportedly forgave Thompson. \u201cHer entire world has been turned upside down,\u201d the source said, adding, \u201cShe cried hysterically all night. She begged to come back to L.A. and tried to find any way to make it work but her doctor wouldn\u2019t let her. She just wants to be with her family and leave as soon as possible. Kris is there and completely supporting her.\u201d Here\u2019s hoping the couple just figures out what ever route will work best for themselves and their family.

Well TMZ reports that Kim & Kanye just had an appraiser come by their new mansion to see how much its worth today, and boy are they making out. The appraiser reportedly said Kimye\u2019s new mansion is worth an outstanding $60 million, which if you do the math is already a net profit of nearly $20 million dollars (20 purchase + 20 renovations = 20 profit). The 10,000 square foot mansion, which is only 5 minutes from Kris Jenner\u2019s house, has 8 bedrooms, 2 pools, and a 1,050 square foot entertainment pavilion. Real estate people in the area had called it \u201cthe jewel of Hidden Hills,\u201d and that was BEFORE all the renovations were added to it.\n\nThis news comes just a day after reports surfaced that the two weren\u2019t going to keep any jewelry at their new house to help keep thieves away.

However, that positive momentum may have been snuffed out by this latest news, which is putting Mimi on the receiving end of a lawsuit that is trying to hit her up for millions of dollars.\n\nAccording to The Daily Mail, Carey is being sued for $3 million by the promotion company Fenix over a pair of cancelled 2016 concerts in South America. Carey had originally sued the promoters over the same shows, which were supposed to go down in Argentina and Chile during her Sweet Sweet Fantasy tour, but the singer ultimately withdrew from those previously scheduled appearances. Carey claims that Fenix didn\u2019t pay her fees that she thought she was due, which supposedly hurt her brand as a performer. However, in new legal docs, the promoter has stated that over $700,000 was paid to the songstress, which represented nearly 75 percent of what she owed in total.\n\nEarlier on in this saga, E! News reported that Carey is seeking to be paid in full for the cancelled shows, since she claims that the unfulfilled dates had to do with how the promoters gave her the runaround and not her inability or unwillingness to perform. We surely haven\u2019t heard the last of this legal drama between Carey and Fenix.

This time, the target of her ire is none other than Kim Kardashian. In case you avoid every article with the word \u201cKardashian\u201d in the title, and simply stumbled upon this one by sheer accident, you might as well get acquainted with the backstory. Basically, Kim Kardashian got some braids, took some clothes off, and photographed herself. Needless to say, the photographs got people talking, including the aforementioned Williams.\n\nBy now, you\u2019re probably familiar with Wendy Williams\u2019 antics. Her no-fucks-given commentary has made many-an-enemy in the hip-hop world, including Method Man, T.I, and 50 Cent. Now, it\u2019s looking likely that Kanye West will join the ranks, as Williams wasted little time in dragging his name through the mud. According to People, Williams had a few opinions on Kim\u2019s photoshoot, stating \u201cKanye makes money, Kim makes more, why are you still doing this? It\u2019s not even about the mother thing, forget the mother thing, because a lot of people will say, \u2018Oh, she\u2019s a mother.\u2019 It\u2019s about, she doesn\u2019t have to do that anymore.\u201d Williams continued, seemingly emboldened by the shocked \u201coooooouuuuuhs\u201d of her live studio audience. \u201cThat would be like Cardi B returning to the pole on a Saturday night or something like that. There were a lot of racy pictures; We saw full boob\u2026 sure she has a beautiful body, but so what. Between taking filtered selfies and the 25 hours it probably took to braid your hair that way.\u201d And finally, the Kanye West name-drop: Kim it\u2019s clear Kanye has nothing for you except dribble and dribble and evil conversation. It is clear that Kanye does not pay attention to you. It\u2019s clear to me that you\u2019re desperately trying to stay in the spotlight.\u201d Do you agree with Wendy's statements?

According to TMZ, the two have reportedly broken up following a massive fight earlier this week.\n\nSources tell TMZ that Black Chyna got into an \u201cexplosive\u201d argument Monday night with Mechie over his constant flirting with women on social media. The two had been dating for not even two months, but that was long enough for him to showcase his love for her by getting her initials behind his ears (see below). The ink hasn\u2019t been dried for a full month yet, and already Chyna has kicked him to the curb.\n\nFollowing the argument Monday night, Blac reportedly hit up the Tarzana studio in LA and found inspiration to vent her frustration on the mic & record some new music. And after she was done in the booth, TMZ learned that Rob Kardashian\u2019s ex hit up the strip club Ace of Diamonds. That same night, her baby daddy\u2019s sister, Khloe Kardashian, also showed up to the club with her now boyfriend Tristan Thompson. TMZ says the ladies crossed paths & gave a little stare down, but nothing ultimately happened of course.\n\nAccording to TMZ, Mechie is still trying to get back his ex girl Chyna, but she\u2019s apparently ain\u2019t having it. However, knowing her past record, the on again off again routine is pretty common, and history definitely has a tendency to repeat itself.\n\nAll of this news comes in the midst of Chyna\u2019s on-going legal battle with Rob Kardashian for battle of custody over their child Dream. Neither of them have requested for child support, but if it were to be requested, Chyna would have to pay Rob based on the fact she makes more money than him.\nNevertheless, we\u2019ll continue to keep you posted on Blac Chyna moving forward.

No further information has been revealed on Tyrese\u2019s visiting rights to his daughter since a restraining order was put on by Norma.\n\nPrevious details on the case noted that Norma wasn\u2019t looking to strip Tyrese of ever seeing Shayla again but simply wanted him to get help since she cited previous abuse he inflicted on her.

According to TMZ, the New York icon was recently arrested for domestic violence, after allegedly striking the mother of his children, \u201cLove And Hip-Hop\u201d star Emily B. As it happens, Fab actually turned himself in to New Jersey police officers, after Emily called the police to report the attack.\n\nAccording to the still-developing story, Fab visited the precinct with his attorney already in tow. He ultimately skated on doing any then-and-there jail time, but got booked for an upcoming court date nonetheless. It\u2019s difficult to gauge whether or not Emily will be pressing further charges, as the on-again-off-again couple no doubt have a complicated and deep-rooted history. Hopefully she\u2019s okay; no woman should have to experience anything of that nature.\n\nThe news comes at a time where domestic abuse in hip-hop seems to be running rampant. Not only has the recently unearthed footage of XXXTentacion slapping a women led to a heated discourse between fans and haters, but YoungBoy Never Broke Again was also taken in under similar circumstances. While Fab clearly has his demons to sort out, the pair remain intimately linked through a familial bond; together, they have two children, ages two and ten.

According to reports, Williams\u2019 husband Kevin Hunter is leading a double life \u2013 engaging in a secret long-term affair with a younger massage therapist.\n\nDailyMail exclusively broke the news after what was said to be a year-long investigation , that the 46-year-old has been seeing Sharina Hudson, 32, for more than 10 years, splitting his time between the New Jersey home he shares with Williams, 53, and their teenage son Kevin Jr, and a secluded suburban house that he bought for his mistress just nine miles down the road.\n\nIn what could be a blow for his wife of 20 years, Hunter \u2013 who manages his TV star wife\u2019s career and runs a production company that they jointly own \u2013 is said to be \u2018in love\u2019 with both women and is juggling his time to accommodate them both.\n\nIn fact, just days after Hunter was photographed strolling along a beach in Barbados during a romantic break with Williams, he was snapped spending time with Sharina back in Morristown, New Jersey.\n\nAs expected, Wendy Williams nor Kevin Hunter had comment at this time.

To bring you up to speed quickly, Kim, Rob and Kris just responded to Chyna\u2019s lawsuit yesterday in which she accused the Kardashian family of sabotaging her reality show \u201cRob & Chyna\u201d out of revenge. Chyna believes that the family as a whole had conspired with the E! network to cancel her and Rob\u2019s series. However, according to the Kardashians, the real reason the show was canned is that Chyna got that domestic violence restraining order against Rob after the two began to fight on the regular, \u201cmaking it impossible to shoot a show with interactions between the [two].\u201d Apparently the Kardashians claim that her restraining order was the reason for the show\u2019s cancellation has left Chyna absolutely livid at the moment, and Chyna thinks they\u2019re sending a terrible message to women that getting a domestic violence restraining order is a bad thing.\n\nAccording to TMZ, Chyna says she was in fear for the safety of her and her daughter, and women should not lose jobs just because they try to protect their family from violence. She says Rob physically abused her, and he continuously denies it.\n\nHowever this is a minor flaw in Chyna\u2019s story. As pointed out, she dropped the restraining order outright back in September after Rob agreed to pay her $20k a month in child support. And as one Kardashian source said, if she really felt threatened she would never have dropped the restraining order.

Tran revealed that she thought the Rih Rih looked \u201cgood.,\u201d saying \u201cI need to know what she been doing, I need to get thick like that.\u201d The man then asked Tran if she noticed how Brown commented on Rihanna\u2019s picture with the eyes emoji. \u201cI would do the same thing if that was my ex,\u201d she replied.\n\nAlthough both Tran and Brown have praised Rihanna\u2019s picture, the singer has received some criticism from fans, accusing her of photoshopping the image. In the picture, it looks like the singer may have manipulated the photo, because her hand which is placed on her stomach looks as if she has a second nail on her thumb.

Apparently, the \u201cDeuces\u201d songwriter wrote a threatening tweet to Chris Brown and his daughter, Royalty, and fans are pissed off.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s start with the shooting. According to TMZ, while McCall was leaving a corner store, a shootout erupted and McCall shot in the foot while trying to run away from the gun battle. The 32-year-old artist was taken to Centinela Hospital in Inglewood on Wednesday (Jan. 3) to repair three broken toes and a fractured tibia. He\u2019s currently listed in stable condition.\n\nBut here is where it gets messy. On Saturday (Jan. 6), McCall responded to a gossip report that said Chris Brown\u2019s goons may have something to do with the shooting. McCall went on his Twitter page and tweeted out that he would put Chris Brown and his seed (Royalty) in a casket if he was linked to him being shot.\n\nOf course, his threatening tweet didn\u2019t sit well with Brown\u2019s fans. If you don\u2019t know, McCall and Brown have been beefing with each other for several years now and McCall\u2019s latest tweet only makes things more complicated. \"I don\u2019t see wat I said wrong.

His tweet is enough evidence to lock him up. PERIOD!\u201d wrote one person.\n\nLet\u2019s hope that Kevin McCall\u2019s misjudgment with his tweet doesn\u2019t lead into anymore violence.

After requesting that her fans delete the app in protest, Snap reportedly saw a decrease of $800 million in market value over two days, while the CEO of the company saw a loss of $150 million from his net worth.\n\nPrior to the controversy, Kylie Jenner, the most followed user on the platform, similarly tweeted that she rarely opens the app anymore.

Business Insider notes how there is a 40% chance that Apple will acquire the streaming giant, a figure based off of new corporate tax reforms that were recently put in place by President Trump.\n\nThis tax cut, coupled alongside a new bill that allows companies to repatriate cash stored in overseas accounts without a major tax hit, will essentially give Apple a fighting chance at putting their money to good use. The California-based tech conglomerate has about $252 billion in cash stored internationally, which was previously barred from being brought into the US for business purposes. If Apple were to access these funds, they may use this fortune to purchase Netflix, which is estimated to be worth $87 billion USD.\n\nApple has been struggling to dominate the realm of original content, as the user count of Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime continues to skyrocket. However, the company has tapped Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon to star in their first scripted video series, giving their introduction into content creation a dose of Hollywood royalty.\n\nHowever, according to business insiders, the acquisition seems unlikely at the moment, as Apple recently allocated $1 billion USD into financing the production of original content.\n\nNeither Apple nor Netflix have addressed these rumours yet.

Perry\u2019s Acrimony, which stars Taraji P.

I wanted it to describe who Melinda [Henson] was, and when I found the word I knew it had to be the title of my movie.\u201d Initially, Perry was going to call the film She\u2019s Living My Life, but apparently, that was \u201ctoo on the nose.\u201d The spike in dictionary-searches for the word came as a surprise to the filmmaker. \u201cSo now it\u2019s educational,\u201d he said. Tyler Perry\u2019s Acrimony will be in theaters March 30. Another movie Perry will be working on, The List, will star Tiffany Haddish, who may or may not be getting catfished by a boyfriend in the film. The List is set to be hit theaters in November of 2018.\n\nOh, and in case you\u2019re wondering, Merriam-Webster defines acrimony as being \u201canger and bitterness; harsh or biting sharpness especially of words, manner, or feelings.\u201d There you go.

According to her, Rich has been sleeping around quite a bit on the side with some well-known names. In a since-deleted post, Rich The Kid\u2019s wife took to Instagram to share a screengrab of her husband\u2019s conversation with model Miracle Watts, as well exposing his extensive unfaithfulness with Blac Chyna, India Love, Tori Brixx and Bria Myles.\n\nRich The Kid has not made any comments about the cheating allegations but his wife\u2019s post makes at least one extracurricular relationship clear with Miracle Watts. The texts confirm that RTK has been buying women\u2019s Louie Vuitton shoes for somebody other than his wife, which prompted her to expose her husband. The caption to the deleted comments claims that Rich has been buying flights for women but neglecting to spend time with his children.\n\nWhile it was rumored that Rich The Kid was fooling around with Blac Chyna, Chyna has also been linked to YBN Almighty Jay and Swae Lee, dispelling the gossip for a while. With the news coming from his wife, the allegations appear to be as legitimate as they\u2019ll get. Check out the post at www.itsKenBarbie.com and decide for yourself.

His contributions over the years have helped shape the way that hip hop is today, for better or for worse. However, his lyricism and overall ability to string together words are untouched. For many rappers that have emerged over the past seven or eight years, it\u2019s common for them to list Wayne as one of the greatest to ever do it. Today, the rapper shares his list for the five GOATs in hip hop.\n\nLil Wayne recently spoke to Complex earlier today to share his top five rappers of all time. The rapper\u2019s list consists of some heavyweights from the South and the east coast. Among them are Cam\u2019ron, UGK, 8 Ball & MJG, Missy Elliot and Jay-Z. Considering Wayne\u2019s versatility as an emcee, his top five of all time doesn\u2019t come as a shock as each person on this list has carried their unique swag, both through their sonics and aesthetics.\n\nAside from his list, the rapper recently sparked some controversy over the weekend. During his headlining gig at High Times Cannabis Cup on Sunday, the rapper threatened to call on his \u201cshooters\u201d after people through stuff on stage. Interestingly enough, this marks the second time he\u2019s been less than content with his performance at the Cannabis Cup. The rapper was tapped to perform during the 2016 event and had a fit on stage because the people in the crowd were stoned and not as responsive as he\u2019d like them to be.

And as he\u2019s always been a little on the rotund side, Khaled recently linked up with Weight Watchers as an official spokesperson, in order to take his health more seriously.

Sometimes, you have to take things to the extreme. At least, that was Desiigner\u2019s logic during a recent altercation in New York City. A few days back, the rapper found himself in a traffic dispute with another driver, and the misunderstanding quickly escalated. In the footage below, the Timmy Turner rapper can be seen yelling \u201csuck my dick,\u201d pulling his pants down, and whipping out the tool. Naturally, people weren\u2019t trying to see that, and the lewd gesture only served to inflame tension.\n\nBoth the recipient of the flash and a woman on scene began yelling back at the rapper, but it was too late \u2013 the retinal damage was already done. As if New York traffic wasn\u2019t already bad enough. And while the situation was clearly the result of some heated tempers, TMZ has reported that law enforcement officials are looking to have a word with Desiigner, specifically the NYPD. It\u2019s hard to say whether or not anything will come of this, but it\u2019s not exactly a good look for the rapper; pulling the dick out in broad daylight is seldom the wisest course of action. In fact, an angry enough person might very well attempt to make a case for sexual assault. Check out the video in the FULL story at www.itsKenBarbie.com\n\nIn other Desiigner related news, the rapper has been hard at work on his anticipated Life Of Desiigner album. There\u2019s no word on whether this recent debacle will have any effect on his situation, but we\u2019ll be sure to keep you posted.

If you're unfamiliar with his work, he's helmed some of the most important music clips in history\u2014Britney Spears' \"Toxic,\" Destiny's Child's \"Say My Name,\" and even Brandy and Monica's \"The Boy is Mine.\" He also directed Swift's most recent video, \"Look What You Made Me Do.\" The man is talented\u2014insanely talented.\nBut goddamnit, Kahn\u2019s talking is getting in the way of my appreciation for his videos. First, he tweeted about how cultural appropriation is \u201chot\u201d and actually not bad at all. Then, he came for the BeyHive, which is just a fundamental mistake in 2017. And now he\u2019s pitting Swift and Beyonc\u00e9 against each other for no reason at all.' Let\u2019s back up: When Swift teased her \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d video before the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards, people started saying she ripped off Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Formation era. Of course, the comparisons went away after Swift dropped the full video. Truthfully, they\u2019re not really that similar\u2014which Kahn said in a (very rational) tweet right before the video was released.\n\nHis latest comments about the situation, however, are not rational. Instead of putting the Bey vs. Taylor fire out for good, Kahn chose to say this in his recent interview with the Los Angeles Times: \u201c[\u2018Look What You Made Me Do\u2019 is] not \u2018Formation\u2019 at all. They try to say she\u2019s wearing a black\ncrop top and Beyonc\u00e9 wore a black crop top. But they don\u2019t realize in\n2015 in \u2018Bad Blood,\u2019 Taylor Swift was wearing a black crop top. I\nreally do think, by the way, that Beyonc\u00e9 copied \u2018Bad Blood.\u2019\u201d Um, what? Beyonc\u00e9 copied the \u201cBad Blood\u201d video? Girl\u2026 How? When? Upon reading Khan\u2019s comments I did my own mini-investigation for similarities between the videos\u2026There are none. At no point in Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Lemonade did she throw on a red wig and recruit a group of Victoria\u2019s Secret models to wage an intergalactic war against Selena Gomez\u2019s bob. She didn\u2019t wear latex or knee-high boots and stomp around while Lena Dunham smoked a cigar. She didn\u2019t have a kiki with three Hailee Steinfelds.

With this scandal behind him, Envy can focus on this other commitments, none the least of which is a new album titled Just A Kid From Queens. The first teaser single, \u201cText Ur Number,\u201d features Fetty Wap and DJ Sliink as featured artists. No doubt that Envy is looking ahead to his new material and not into the past at racy messages that aren\u2019t even his.

Many who have no ties to blackness have felt the need to chant it from their favorite hip-hop songs\u2013 even Victoria Secret models.\n\nOn Tuesday evening (Nov. 28) the pre-taped Victoria Secret Fashion Show aired on CBS, which meant plenty of behind the scenes moments landed on social media. One in particular shows a batch of supermodels singing Cardi B\u2019s chart-topping hit, \u201cBodak Yellow.\u201d With no woman of color around, it also shows them saying the catchy line, \u201cAnd I\u2019m quick to cut a ni**a off so don\u2019t get comfortable.\u201d Unfortunately, some of the ladies were comfortable saying the n-word.\n\nThe video was originally posted by model Camilla Rowe, who condemned the use of the word after her video gained traction. \u201cBlack artists can say it in their songs,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cBlack people can use it as freely as they want. If you\u2019re not black, don\u2019t say it. End of discussion.\u201d Fans were quick to point out in that St. Louis native and model Devon Windsor refrained from joining her VS sisters in saying the n-word. It proves the point author Ta-Nehisi Coates makes in his now-viral speech about white hip-hop fans and the n-word. \u201cI think for white people the experience of being a hip-hop fan and not being able to use the word \u201cni**a\u201d is actually very insightful,\u201d he said. \u201cIt gives you a peek into the world of what its like to be black. There\u2019s a lot to be learned from refraining.\u201d Kudos to Rowe and Windsor. What do you guys think? Were the models wrong for using the word?

The two of them had a massive influence in the way trap music came out in the mid-2000\u2019s and are two figures that undoubtedly had an influence on the current generation of hip hop, period. Now, back in 2014, the two of them announced they\u2019d be dropping a collaborative project together titled Dope Boy Academy. While they promised it\u2019s release, it hasn\u2019t seen the light of day. Not that we could really blame them, the two have been busy on their own careers. However, T.I. and Jeezy are still gunning to drop the project.\n\nFor anyone who\u2019s a fan of either fan, just know they haven\u2019t forgot about you. T.I. recently spoke to Billboard where he revealed that he\u2019s eager to get cracking on the project. \u201cI just wanna go and get started,\u201d he told them, \u201cYou know, me and Young, we tend to go back and forth because Young, he does a lot of contemplating, which is very good, because that\u2019s how you come up with the best ideas, but I just move. I\u2019m ready to go.\u201d There\u2019s no doubt that they\u2019ve been busy in their own rights. Jeezy also spoke to Billboard in another interview from a month a go where he explained what exactly was holding the project back. He said that at the time of the announcement, they were really on it. However, due to the fact that Jeezy went on tour and T.I. got caught up in other commitments, the project got put on hold. Jeezy said the idea of a movie was spoken on that would also be accompanied by a soundtrack. \u201cA movie could take us a year to do and get the script right and get everything together. You can\u2019t just throw it together, whereas with the album, I feel like we can finish in a week. This was my argument. But for as long as it\u2019s taking us to do this album, we might as well have done a movie,\u201d he said.\n\nSo hopefully, with the idea still lodged in both rappers heads, maybe Dope Boy Academy may see the light of day in the near future.

And then that went viral and that\u2019s the first and the last time that I\u2019ve ever seen or met Phaedra.\u201d So, for the record, the notorious bachelor is still on the market and somebody should let Phaedra know. She helped start the rumor by posting a photo of her and Shemar from their WWHL appearance and referred to him as \u201cbae.\u201d The post was most likely to promote Shemar\u2019s new CBS show S.W.A.T. However, she\u2019s done nothing to put the rumor to bed, leaving many to believe she\u2019s capitalizing on the publicity to either get back on The Real Housewives of Atlanta or to pitch another reality show idea.\n\nThe lawyer is said to be pitching an \u201carbitration-based reality court show\u201d to networks, which was rejected by Bravo years ago.\n\nIt sounds like Phaedra is back to her old tricks: lying on people for her own gain.

Her latest stance is having Nicki Minaj\u2019s back after the rapper said she re-introduced the female rapper to mainstream music. Nicki went in detail to XXL saying \u201cmy role in hip-hop has been super unique because when my first album came out, there had been so much time where there wasn\u2019t a female rap album out that went platinum.\u201d During Wendy\u2019s talk show yesterday morning, she shared the hot topic with her viewers, telling them \u201cNicki Minaj is crediting herself for making female rap mainstream.\u201d Right away the crowd gave a gasp, clearly not agreeing with the comment. \u201cWell now, haters, you might not like her, but she said \u2018mainstream,\u2019 as in, you go into Kmart and there\u2019s her clothing, you turn on pop music stations and there\u2019s her music. Lil Kim had her moment, but by the time she went to jail, she just couldn\u2019t get it back together afterwards,\u201d Wendy said. \u201cNicki does say in XXLmagazine that, \u2018There wasn\u2019t a big female rap presence right before I got in\u2026My role was reintroducing the female rapper to pop culture.\u2019 I agree! I don\u2019t know if she should\u2019ve said it herself\u2026\u201d Watch the clip below.\n\nAfter Nicki\u2019s interview went public lots of people were quick to throw a few jabs at her alluding to her being full of herself or thinking she\u2019s better than lots of other female rappers such as Queen Latifah and Eve. She posted a video with the original footage of her interview on Instagram so no one could \u201cremix\u201d her words. Her caption was lengthy since she dropped facts on the past successes of female rappers and asked her fans to check the facts. She ended her rant with, \u201c\u2026love you guys for holding me down but what\u2019s true is true & whats not is just simply not.\u201d Check out Wendy\u2019s initial comments and Nicki\u2019s response at www.itsKenBarbie.com .

Every year the festival gifts fans with the positive externalities of seeing their faves in candid moments as they enjoy performances from the industry\u2019s best. This weekend, Tyga and Iggy Azalea found themselves one of the many subjects in said candid moments and may have inadvertently hinted at a budding relationship if social media has anything to do with it.\n\nSpeculation first arose when Tyga shared a Snapchat post of his Coachella essentials, including a collection of at least six pairs of Ian Connor\u2019s Revenge X Storm sneakers. Soon after, Iggy would post her own Coachella outfit, complete with a pair of the signature shoe. Is this evidence damning enough to hear wedding bells? We\u2019re not so convinced, but what\u2019s got folks in a frenzy is the video of the two cozied up during The Weeknd\u2019s headlining set Friday night. It was as Abel delivered on a live version of his Belly collab \u201cMight Not\u201d that Tyga was spotted with his arm around Iggy.\n\nNow, this isn\u2019t the first time a seemingly friendly embrace has contributed dating rumors around the two. Earlier in the year, Iggy joined Tyga onstage during his set at the Jumanji festival in her native Australia, and the duo\u2019s hug following his appearance was enough to get the ball rolling.\n\nTo add more fuel to the flames, Iggy and Tyga were also at the same Coachella weekend party attended by Travis Scott and Kylie Jenner. According to Entertainment Tonight, they arrived \u201chand in hand\u201d at the TAO x Revolve \u2013 Desert Nights party Friday night. They spent most of the night with rapper Won-G and Kourtney Kardashian\u2019s boyfriend Younes Bendjima, both of whom were also present in the video captured during The Weeknd\u2019s set.\n\nDo you think Tyga and Iggy would make a cute couple?

He\u2019s taking people who have potential, placing them with the right people, and allowing them to truly flourish.

It turns out that, as per L.A. regulations, construction is allowed to begin any time after 7 a.m., so whomever was having their roof done was well within their rights to be doing so. I guess Chyna wasn\u2019t aware of this initially, but after talking things over with the cops, she simmered down and any further verbal altercations with the neighbor was averted.\n\nNoise disturbances are merely a small blip on Chyna\u2019s radar these days, with previous reports indicating that she\u2019s in the studio working on an album.

Rich has yet to respond to the report nor the cheating allegations directly.\n\nHis wife posted screenshots of text messages that seem to confirm the relations he\u2019s had with several of these industry women. In one of the messages from India Love, she asks him if he\u2019s married which he denied.\n\nAccording to the report Willis accused the rapper in 2016 of domestic violence. He\u2019s denied the allegations and said she\u2019s after his money. Reports have said they have one child together.

Nowadays, she\u2019s managed to define herself as more than the \u201cCash Me Ousside Girl\u201d and into a rapper. However, her career and overall behavior has been criticized not only because of her age but because many feel that she\u2019s appropriated black culture. She hasn\u2019t really responded to any of it until recently.\n\nIn an interview with The Fader, Bhad Bhabie finally responded to criticisms of cultural appropriation that have been surfacing ever since she became a meme. Bregoli told them that the concept of cultural appropriation is \u201cridiculous.\u201d \u201cI look at that cultural appropriation shit and I just ignore it because it\u2019s ridiculous, it really is. You cannot act a color. Do not tell me I\u2019m acting black because I\u2019m not,\u201d she said, \u201cHow I act is me. I get braids all the time, you can\u2019t tell me I\u2019m acting black because I braid my hair. That makes no sense whatsoever. One race does something more than another race.\u201d She further elaborates on the thought by saying that \u201cif someone wants to do something they should just do it, as long as they\u2019re happy with it.\u201d You could watch the interview with her full comments around the 3:33 mark at www.itsKenBarbie.com "}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/206b82675c460af0069555fbf4c94f89/5B5D1CA4/t51.2885-15/e35/25007920_316142042204273_6787499962201538560_n.jpg", "tags": ["#nene", "#neneleakes", "#rhoa", "#realhousewivesofatlanta", "#realhousewives", "#realhousewivesofatl", "#fashionpolice", "#e", "#joanrivers", "#ripjoanrivers", "#melissarivers", "#entertainment", "#entertainmentnews", "#media", "#gossip", "#gossipblog", "#gossipblogger", "#celebrities", "#celebritynews"], "comments": 6, "likes": 374, "date": "2017-10-19T04:28:09.000Z", "description": "NeNe Leakes is out of another job, but this time it\u2019s not due to the fallout over her insensitive rape joke.\n\nIt\u2019s the end of an era.

E! made the announcement today.\n\nThe farewell episode will feature highlights from the show\u2019s run, signature segments, surprise celebrity guests, and will also air never-before-seen clips of Joan. It will be hosted by Joan\u2019s daughter Melissa Rivers and current panelists Giuliana Rancic, Brad Goreski, Margaret Cho, and NeNe. \u201cI am so proud to have been a part of this show and am so proud that it\u2019s part of my mother\u2019s legacy,\u201d Melissa said a statement. \u201cIt really changed, along with the red carpets, awards-show programming and fashion.\u201d Melissa has served as the show\u2019s executive producer since the beginning and took over her mother\u2019s hosting duties in 2015.\n\nE! president Adam Stotsky praised Joan, Melissa, and the show\u2019s contribution to the network in a statement: \u201cFashion Police has been a red carpet mainstay for over two decades that has been emulated across the entertainment landscape. Joan\u2019s beloved no-holds-barred style fueled the franchise\u2019s clever approach to fashion and comedy, and we are incredibly proud of its long-running success. \u201cWe are also especially grateful to Melissa, as well as Giuliana, Brad, Nene, Margaret and the entire \u2018Fashion Police\u2019 team, who have continued to deliver the laughs and make this iconic franchise truly one of a kind.\u201d Fashion Police was first launched in 1995 due to Joan and Melissa\u2019s popular red carpet coverage and it revitalized the late comedian\u2019s career. It was adapted into a weekly series in 2010 until Joan\u2019s unexpected death in 2014, which saw the show shift to special episodes to recap awards show fashions. Will you miss the show?

He was the star on the LA Clippers squad, who won the game 75-66 against the LA Lakers team.\n\nQuavo had a few highlighted moments throughout the game, including his block on Justin Bieber and his smooth and-one Eurostep layup in the 4th quarter. Although he didn\u2019t complete the 3-point play by missing the free throw, it was a nice play regardless.\n\nQuavo wasn\u2019t the only one player to ball though. Female NBA2KTV host & model, Rachel DeMita, also showed out for the ladies. The former D1 basketball player finished the game with 17 points, but on the losing end.\n\nIn addition to the two stars of evening, other celebrities who participated in Friday\u2019s night game included Jamie Foxx, who made some headline prior to the game for his awkward interview (see here), Nate Robinson, Drew Scott, Kris Wu, Candace Parker, Jerry Ferrara, Andre De Grasse, Win Butler, Miles Brown, Bubba Watson, Jason Williams, and more.\n\nIn case you happened to have missed it, we compiled some of the highlights & moments from the Celebrity all-star game in the FULL story at www.itsKenBarbie.com "}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/d9499110e1531dbd0b976be04945b306/5B5D5338/t51.2885-15/e35/26067290_398896480545483_5927774627689398272_n.jpg", "tags": ["#GoldenGlobes2018", "#mariah", "#mariahcarey", "#mimi", "#lamb", "#lambs", "#goldenglobes"], "comments": 4, "likes": 378, "date": "2018-01-08T01:30:15.000Z", "description": "Whew! \ud83d\ude0d Is it the Emancipation of Mimi era again? @mariahcarey does "}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/89d88c04023e7ae60c1d16b36f62c0d1/5AE54E32/t51.2885-15/e15/28764687_416423992131863_1445119477057323008_n.jpg", "tags": ["#AccessHollywood", "#FlavorOfLove", "#ILoveNewYork", "#hbic", "#tiffanypollard", "#newyork", "#tiffanynewyorkpollard", "#vh1", "#access", "#accesshollywood", "#accesshollywoodlive"], "comments": 25, "likes": 2558, "date": "2018-03-20T23:36:47.000Z", "description": "I CANNOT TAKE IT. \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude0d The ORIGINAL queen of reality television sat down with "}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/ff7a381e476198f59aaf28d2b295747f/5B98D15A/t51.2885-15/e35/28766210_985766604910039_4681148911052652544_n.jpg", "tags": ["#IggyAzalea", "#Pinkhair", "#pinkhairdontcare", "#iggy", "#iggyazalea", "#thenewclassic", "#digitaldistortion", "#survivingthesummer"], "comments": 14, "likes": 574, "date": "2018-03-16T23:14:36.000Z", "description": "NEW HAIR, WHO DAT \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\ude43\u2615\ufe0f Looks like the beautiful "}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/7d64693dad9be26b5334a8fdec239ff7/5B6272DE/t51.2885-15/e35/28155358_2487983808094336_5941134033269293056_n.jpg", "tags": ["#WhoopiGoldberg", "#Oscars2018", "#ChristianSiriano", "#whoopi", "#whoopigoldberg", "#theview", "#sistermaryclarence", "#theviewabc", "#oscar", "#oscars"], "comments": 25, "likes": 7527, "date": "2018-03-05T03:32:53.000Z", "description": "AUNTIE MARY CLARENCE \ud83d\ude2e Y\u2019all feeling "}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/548e5db2e98486e0f1c20a1d19504663/5B5ACBDA/t51.2885-15/e35/25011714_519290961773644_6237610119564099584_n.jpg", "tags": [], "comments": 8, "likes": 718, "date": "2017-08-06T16:31:11.000Z", "description": "Listen, I am not tropical, I am not toucan Sam, and I do not enjoy this heat.

Fans are straight up angry and they\u2019re demanding to know if Janet Jackson will ever return to the Super Bowl. After all, the singer has unfairly borne the brunt of the criticism in the years since \u201cNipplegate,\u201d as it\u2019s come to be called, and fans are worried that apparent imbalance may still be an issue.\n\nOf course, Timberlake is far from officially confirmed for the 2018 halftime show. NFL Vice President of Communications Brian McCarthy responded to the rumor with the following statement: \u201cNo decisions have been made on the performer(s) and we are not going to speculate on particular artists. Along with Pepsi, we know that we will put on a spectacular show. When it is time to announce her name we will do it. Or his name. Or their names.\u201d However the main question is whether or not Jackson is still blacklisted from performing at the Super Bowl, as TMZ reported was the case in 2014. (Representatives for Timberlake, Jackson, and the NFL did not immediately respond to Bustle\u2019s requests for comment on this matter.) And since nothing official has yet been announced, there is, of course, still a possibility that, if Timberlake is invited back, Jackson may be as well.

According to their report, Jay-Z\u2019s net worth went up from $810M to $900M within the past year. The rise in numbers is mainly due to the rising interests of his liquor investments, Armand De Brignac champagne and D\u2019usse.

All Hallow\u2019s Eve is as much about strutting your unique costume style as it is about scary monsters and mini chocolate bars, and the Kardashian clan member was front and center, posing for pictures with a friend while dressed as an angel. However, the specific way in which those selfies were taken has led fans to speculate that rumors of Jenner\u2019s pregnancy are in fact true.\n\nThe reality TV star and cosmetics magnate played one half of a sumptuous fire and ice combo last night, clad all in white and sporting some detailed angel\u2019s wings, while her friend was dressed completely in red, representing the devil that sits on one shoulder of most people. Whether or not she meant to do this strategically or not, many fans in the comments section for the above photo, around the praise for both Kylie\u2019s costume and overall physique, were immediately mindful of the fact that there were no full body shots of the teenage star in her costume. Indeed, anything much below the chest area remained shrouded in photographic secrecy, even a couple of short video clips that were also posted to Jenner\u2019s Instagram page.\n\nMany are taking this to mean that Kylie really is pregnant and is hiding her growing midsection from the intense gaze of the camera. With no confirmation publicly coming from her or boyfriend Travis Scott, there\u2019s no way of telling for sure if this was an intentional avoidance or not. However, as per previous reports about the couple\u2019s supposed pregnancy, both her and Scott are in full-on prep mode for a new addition to their family. They\u2019ve reportedly dropped upwards of $70,000 on items for the tyke already but managed to keep other details under wraps when they were spotted together in Houston not long ago.\n\nWhat do you think?

The album cover shows a man with prominent back tattoos performing oral sex on Cardi as she sips from a bottle of beer. A model sued the blossoming rapper last year after claiming that his back tattoos were photoshopped into the album cover. Kevin Brophy, the man filing the documents, is asking for $5 million dollars as he never consented to his image being used in such a sexual nature, affirming that he did not pose for the photo or sign off on anything.\n\nCardi B and her team are certain the man suing her, Kevin Brophy, is trying to extort her. \u201cWhatever piece of Cardi B\u2019s income he can gouge out, and whatever free ride on her famous coattails he can gain, through extortionate means of this unfounded, preposterous action,\u201d the documents say. Her team also states that since Brophy is never named or identified in the album\u2019s artwork, there isn\u2019t any harm being done.\n\nThere seems to be a catch in the lawsuit though. Cardi B and her legal team are claiming that the man in the photo is a \u201cyoung, dark-skinned male\u201d while the plaintiff is a middle-aged Caucasian man. While the tats are strikingly similar upon comparison, Cardi is hoping that one element of the ink leads to her winning the case. TMZ notes that the man suing has a neck tattoo that reads \u201cBorn To Lose\u201d on his neck, while Cardi\u2019s model does not have any neck tattoos.\n\nWhile the back tattoos tattoos do look strikingly similar, the design itself may have been digitally lifted and placed on the model who actually is in the photo. This makes a lot of sense considering Cardi\u2019s legal team called the photo \u201ca classic example of transformative work created in the exercise of the First Amendment rights of the photographer.\u201d Get the FULL story at www.itskenbarbie.com "}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/cfb960501fd270df8ca0187b5578b7ce/5B5BF84A/t51.2885-15/e35/28428792_166772117311035_136270791086964736_n.jpg", "tags": ["#chrisbrown", "#chrisbreezy", "#breezy", "#chrisbrownfans", "#chrisbrownconcert", "#lizianegutierrez", "#seventygrand", "#settlement", "#brown", "#chris", "#entertainment", "#entertainmentblog", "#entertainmentnews", "#media", "#gossip", "#celebrities", "#celebrityblogger", "#kenbarbie", "#itskenbarbie"], "comments": 25, "likes": 578, "date": "2018-03-11T00:48:24.000Z", "description": "You read that right.\n\nIt was last year in September that Chris Brown reportedly struck a settlement in the aftermath of a lawsuit for assault after Brazilian model Liziane Gutierrez alleged that the singer punched her in the face and took her phone in Las Vegas after she took a picture of him during a private party at the Palms Hotel, leaving her with a black eye.\n\nWhile initial reports suggested that Gutierrez made off with $70,000 in the case, other sources contradicted the amount saying that Chris Brown paid out much less.

She\u2019s been pushing her music on iTunes and through reality TV for about five years now, and she\u2019s never been within striking distance of the Billboard Hot 100 or the Latin Billboard Charts.\nI personally haven\u2019t been a fan of many of the Joseline tracks I\u2019ve heard.

In the wake of the most bizarre rendition of the Star Spangled Banner in recent memory, Fergie has been taking heat from all angles; some have even taking to calling her take on the National Anthem a worst-of-all-time contender. Footage reveals the likes of Chance The Rapper, Jimmy Kimmel, Joel Embiid, LeBron James, and Draymond Green holding back laughter while she serenades the world with her sultry rendition. Today, Fergie has found herself at the center of attention for all the wrong reasons. It\u2019s not easy to live down a gaffe of this magnitude, but the former Black Eyed Peas singer has one experienced player in her corner.\n\nThe folks at TMZ recently caught up with the legendary diva Mariah Carey, whose antics and mishaps are well documented. The cameraman asked a busy Mariah whether or not she had any advice for Fergie, and Mariah came through with a brief response. \u201cDarling, nobody needs to listen to that,\u201d says Mariah, referring to the chorus of hate and ridicule. After all, she has lived through a similar incident in the not-too-distant past.\n\nFans and haters alike will no doubt recall when Mariah Carey experienced her own moment in fail history, during a performance at Time Square for 2017 New Year\u2019s Eve. For reasons unknown, Carey decided to stop singing mid-set, attempting to pass it off to the audience. It didn\u2019t work. While she went on to bounce back with a strong outing for the 2018 NYE event, she previously found herself being subjected to an equally relentless barrage of clowning. It stands to reason that she knows what Fergie is going through, and while her advice isn\u2019t exactly the picture of compassion, it\u2019s still a solid piece of wisdom.

So, he decided to donate $1 million to them at the end of 2017 in honor of his mom, who died 5 years ago from pancreatic cancer.\u201d TMZ reports that Alexandria House hopes to use Albert\u2019s $1 million donation to buy another complex to accommodate the 600 or so people they turn away monthly simply because they don\u2019t have space.

According to a clip that TMZ obtained, the Chicago singer bullied an autistic fan into singing one of his songs, then made fun of him and accused him of being high on Percocet. As a result, Kellz might have himself a lawsuit on his hands.\n\nSo apparently R. Kelly ran into a fan named Lenny Felix outside a nightclub in Los Angeles the other night. In the clip, you can see Lenny was visibly star struck by running into the R&B singer, and Kelly decided to abuse his power and bait the autistic fan to sing one of his songs, most notably \u201cI Believe I Can Fly.\u201d Rather than showing his appreciation or giving thanks, Kelly looked into the camera and mockingly sang, \u201cI believe that your high, I believe that your touching the sky/ Smoking on that Percocet, Nigga where you goin\u2019 tell me whats next.\u201d Kelly\u2019s fans instantly bursted out laughing in his face, and Lenny\u2019s family was shocked by it all and feel he was victimized, which he most likely was.\n\nLenny\u2019s family told TMZ that their son\u2019s reaction to the clip was, \u201cI don\u2019t want him to think I\u2019m dumb. Do you think he was making fun of me?\u201d And apparently his mom is heartbroken, and says the family has met with an attorney.\n\nThis wouldn\u2019t the first time a celebrity had made fun of a disability fan and had to pay for it though. 50 Cent, Shaquille O\u2019Neal and Waka Flaka have all been sued after mocking fans with disabilities in the past, and it looks like R. Kelly is about to be next.\n\nAfter the clip surfaced online Wednesday morning, Kells took to his social media to responds to these allegations of him making fun of an autistic fan.

She told cops Simmons raped her at his office in \u201983, which jibes with what she said on the show.\n\nThe other woman (who remains anonymous) claims Simmons raped her at his Manhattan residence after they\u2019d gone out on a date in \u201991. She was 32 at the time, and alleges he tried taking off her dress while sitting on a couch, and then pushed her down and forcibly raped her when she rejected his advances.\n\nThe total number of women accusing Simmons of sexual misconduct was 13 \u2014 the anonymous woman makes it 14. Russell has denied all previous claims against him \u2014 and, as we\u2019ve reported, he even took and passed a polygraph in an attempt to refute at least one of the allegations.\n\nThe NYPD is already investigating Simmons for at least 7 claims of sexual misconduct. Russel\u2019s camp has yet to comment on the allegations. Stay tuned to itsKenBarbie.com for more on this story as it comes in.

However, one Twitter user was critical of the fact that Jordan only listed more mainstream fare, and that his love of the art form is shallow and superficial. Again, Jordan provided a response to this brash character judgement, stating how he only listed the more recognizable anime figures for people who aren\u2019t as invested in it as he is.\nCatch that as well as the receipts at www.itsKenBarbie.com Are you willing to watch cartoons with Michael B Jordan while his parents are in the other room?

Just yesterday, Jordan was paid a visit by his co-star in the dressing room during his appearance on The View, who then prompted him to drop down and give her a pushup in front of a room full of people. Jordan admits that there is only three pushups left in their bet, so Nyong\u2019o decides to save the other two for a more fitting time.\n\nHowever, this isn\u2019t the first time the actress has prompted Jordan to do some pushups while out in public, as she recently asked him to do another one at the Calvin Klein Fall/Winter 2018 runway presentation. Jordan got down on the floor, which was covered in popcorn, to fulfill Nyong\u2019o\u2019s demands.\n\nThis behaviour appears to be quite flirty, as if the two have established some sort of personal bond beyond the Black Panther set that has influenced their demeanour during public outings. Could there be a budding romance between the two? Or is Nyong\u2019o just giving Jordan a chance to flex his fit physique for the public?

For instance, Blue Ivy\u2019s 2018 Grammy\u2019s outfit included a tuxedo pantsuit, a black fur coat, a clutch bag, and a pair of shoes complete with Swarovski crystals. Mendez\u2019 job is to make sure that Blue Ivy is stunting everywhere she goes.\n\nMost kids don\u2019t usually find the need to put diamonds on their shoes, but Blue Ivy Carter isn\u2019t like a lot of kids.

The Secretary of Treasury gave us one more example of how much this current administration hates black people by failing to support putting slavery liberator Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill.\n\nIn a Thursday (Aug. 31) interview on CNBC, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said honoring a decision to replace 7th US President Andrew Jackson with an image of Tubman was not one if his primary concerns. He even dismissed the idea again after the interviewer noted the \u201ccultural aspects\u201d of putting a black woman\u2019s face on US currency. \u201cUltimately, we\u2019ll be looking at this issue.

Jackson\u2019s image would be moved to the back of the bill.

I can\u2019t tell you anything but\u2019s really exciting,\u201d she said while sporting a big smile. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you, but it has been an honor to be Gina for all these years.\u201d Rumors kicked off when Martin Lawrence\u2019s fianc\u00e9 Roberta Moradfar posted on Instagram about the reboot. The legendary comedian also replied on the post before it was deleted.\n\nIn an interview with Vanity Fair about the show\u2019s 25th anniversary last year, Lawrence spoke on the cultural impact of the series. \u201cIt\u2019s just hitting me just now,\u201d Lawrence said. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it\u2019s my show that\u2019s so iconic.

What God blessed me to be here to do.\u201d The series launched on FOX Aug. 27, 1992 and aired for five seasons. It also helped propelled the profiles of Campbell-Martin (Gina), Tichina Arnold (Pam), Carl Anthony Payne II (Cole), the late Thomas Mikal Ford (Tommy) and Lawrence. Outside of hypebeats sporting Martin\u2019s funky threads, hip-hop has done a good job of keeping the show alive with homages like Big Sean\u2019s \u201cPlay No Games\u201d and SZA\u2019s CTRL track, \u201cGo Gina.\u201d Plenty of adored series from the past have had success lately.

She\u2019s now asking for an injunction against Nelly and, this is for real, his penis as well.\n\nAccording to TMZ, who have sourced Greene\u2019s new docs, Nelly\u2019s demeanor is all part of a larger plot to, as she sees it, sexually assault women. Apparently, he \u201cseeks out \u2018beautiful women of color\u2019 at his concerts, typically \u2018with beautiful faces and curvy figures,'\u201d as per her revelations. To that end, a member of his entourage will also invite women and friends backstage, in order to hook them into this devious scheme. Greene claims that Nelly is \u201cis particularly attracted to women who were resistant.\u201d Things only get worse from there. Greene alleges that Nelly will frequently masturbate in front of the women \u201cwith the expectation that presenting himself would entitle him to sexual gratification and that the women were drawn to and could not resist his penis.\u201d If any woman caught in such a situation were to resist this advance, Greene says that he \u201csexually accosts and/or assaults her,\u201d which can include (but is not limited to) ejaculating on the woman\u2019s body.\n\nClearly, these allegations against Nelly have become even more serious and potentially career-tainting. His representatives have not responded to these latest revelations, but the last time Greene made information about his supposed rapist tendencies public, the rapper said he intended on fighting the accusations using due process. Only time will tell what happens next in this dark, unseemly saga. Stay tuned to itsKenBarbie.com for more on the story as it comes in.

Many consumers got a jump on that buying frenzy during Black Friday weekend which, as a new report from TechCrunch details, could have led to a big financial boon for the ever-popular technology company.\n\nAccording to information that was originally published by Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang, Apple may have sold up to 6 million iPhone X units during that big shopping weekend around the world. The iPhone maker has not shared an exact number yet, but speculation continues to be rampant in the tech world that, despite some early manufacturing concerns, Apple is well on the way to making this device their new bread and butter.\n\nTo put that figure into perspective, the company sold 39.3 million iPhones during the last fiscal quarter, when you combine all iPhone models. That translates to Apple usually selling around 1.75 million iPhones of any kind during a given 4-day period. So, with that in mind, this past weekend was definitely a huge one financially for Apple, and that\u2019s without taking other iPhone models into account. If you break it down math-wise, the company sold more than 17 iPhone X units every single second during those four days.\n\nIn terms of production, Rosenblatt says that Apple is in the business of manufacturing 3 million units every week. However, with the rabid demand for the iPhone X, this could increase all the way up to 4 million units per week in just a few weeks. In fact, Apple looks to have moved 15 million iPhone X units since going on sale not long ago, if these projection numbers are to be believed.

Speaking with paparazzi, the adult film entertainer cautions Jenner and boyfriend Travis Scott that their newborn will be quite the handful, and the evidence is in her name.\n\nWhen asked by a shutterbug about the name, Daniels admits that she\u2019s pretty sure its a coincidence that the two are both named Stormy, save for different iterations. The actress cheekily reveals that she\u2019s not pretentious enough to assume that Jenner and Scott were inspired by her prolific work in adult entertainment to name their child in honour of her.\n\nDaniels then congratulates the pair on the arrival of their first daughter together, but advises the couple to \u201chang on to your heart, because little girls named Stormi are known to cause trouble.\u201d Daniels was then asked if she had any other advice for the newborn, jokingly admitting how \u201cit\u2019s a tough name to live up to, I hope you\u2019re fierce.\u201d After months of secrecy and hiding from the public gaze, Kylie Jenner made her return to the spotlight in the most newsworthy way, by revealing that she indeed was pregnant with her first child. Stormi was born on February 1, and ended months of speculative gossip aimed squarely at the youngest Jenner.

The 27-year-old claims she has zero sources of income and is requesting Kirk financially contribute to the welfare of 1-year-old Kannon (who Kirk continues to deny), including medical/dental expenses and extra-curricular activities.\n\nShe is also petitioning for permanent custody of Kannon and that Kirk receives no court-ordered visitation in excess of 90 days.\n\nJasmine lists Kirk\u2019s monthly income as $10,000 and says he has the \u201cfinancial capacity\u201d to provide for Kannon. Jasmine is requesting Kirk pay $5,515 a month to cover child care, rent, her car, clothing, and diapers. The court documents show Kirk will be required to pay a minimum of $2,047.89 per month if DNA results prove he is Kannon\u2019s father.\n\nJasmine states that Kirk financially supported her (and Kannon) between Sept. 1, 2015 and Oct. 31, 2016. Kannon was born in July 2016. She says that the Love & Hip Hop Atlanta star moved her into an apartment, paid some of her bills, provided her money for personal use, and gave her a car.\n\nHowever, this financial support stopped when she called off their secret relationship; he even took back the car. Jasmine says Kirk purposefully made her dependent on him and now she is currently unemployed, which causing a \u201csevere disadvantage in her financial ability to protect her interests and the interests of her minor child.\u201d According to the documents, Jasmine has no income and $4,059 in monthly expenses, plus an extra $1,456 per month to creditors. She lists a 2011 Range Rover ($25,000) and furniture ($3,000) as assets, but claims to still owe $40,000 on the luxury SUV.\n\nJasmine also petitions Kirk pay $5,000 of her attorney fees so that she can continue to her child support case against him.

The two have dated since 2000, were married in 2010 and filed for divorce in 2016, with cameras following them every step of the way. While the pair has been getting along well as of late, Tiny appears to have put the proverbial nail in the coffin of their relationship. A new development reported by Bossip shows that Tiny Harris has filed documents to extend the mortgage on the house she purchased after moving out of their family home.\n\nThis appears to be the clearest sign yet that the two are in no rush to get back together and live under the same roof. At the pinnacle of their issues in 2014, Tiny bought the property with the expectation that the mortgage would be paid by April 2016. An extension was already provided to Tiny, and the most recent deal allows her until the end of the current year to pay off the property. With the move to apply for an additional extension of the mortgage, it looks as if Tiny is looking to remain at the house for the long-term, with no plans to move back in with T.I.\n\nWhile much of her income was generated from the success of their joint reality TV venture, Tiny will be using the money she has earned from her R&B group Xscape since their show has since been canceled. Although the mortgage extension does not necessarily confirm a legitimate split between the two, it definitely hints that they have no imminent plans on getting back together. What do you guys think?

Her first gig included The Mod Squad in 1968 and later found fanfare in Chico and the Man. A string of TV guest spots soon followed but fans know Della best due to her role as Tess on Touched by an Angel. After its cancellation in the 1994-95 season, fans demanded its return and it became a hit for CBS, lasting nine seasons.\n\nTo most of us, she\u2019ll be remembered as our favorite auntie.

She quickly became the show\u2019s breakout star because of her personality and fearlessness in speaking up for Afro-Latinos. Since then, she has signed a multi-record, multi-million dollar record deal with BMG and Fast Life Entertainment. \u201cInsecure\u201d debuted on staple New York radio show The Breakfast Club this morning, and is now available on all streaming platforms.

The rapper already has four children with four different baby mamas, including Reginae Carter, who\u2019s been in the gossip cycle as of late thanks to a rumored relationship with YFN Lucci. There may be a fifth child in the mix, if the DNA test proves it.\n\nA judge has ordered Weezy to take a paternity test when it comes to the child of Keiotia Watson. Back in 2015, Watson first filed the necessary legal documents in order to establish Wayne as the father of her child, and to get child support from him. Watson claimed that after having a sexual relationship with Wayne back in 2001, she then gave birth to his child, Dwayne Brown, who is now 16-years old.\n\nDespite a Louisiana judge ruling in favour of Watson at the time, thus ordering Wayne to fork over $5,000 a month in child support, Wayne apparently never gave a cent. Wayne claimed that he had never been served with the legal papers, hence the lack of payment. In the wake of this, the previous judgement was apparently tossed out and a new trial was scheduled in 2017. Fast forward, and here we are, as the case continues to unravel.\n\nIs Wayne the father???

Once the footage was found, it was turned into a ruthless meme and Iggy was the subject of cyberbullying for years after. When a Twitter user brought back the video, saying that the day that the cringe-worthy footage was found was one for the history books, the Aussie rapper responded, detailing her true feelings after she gained infamy for the 2013 performance.\n\nIn a since-deleted tweet, Iggy wrote, \u201cIt was great being bullied endlessly until I literally wanted to die because y\u2019all unearthed a trash performance from the beginning of my career.\u201d Iggy\u2019s relationship with the internet has been rocky, to say the least.

Since her arrival on the scene, her adeptness for bars and melody have impressed her fans as she has steadily built an empire atop a limited class of women in hip-hop. While the scene appears to be expanding, Nicki likely still sits atop the throne without having released an album since 2014. A new feat has cemented Nicki\u2019s legacy even further as she now enjoys an accomplishment that nobody preceding her has experienced.\n\nThe Queens rapper has officially sold over 5 million copies of each of her studio albums, making history as the first female rapper to accomplish such an achievement. With a discography including Pink Friday, Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded and The Pinkprint, the world has embraced Nicki as a superior talent in hip-hop, allowing her to move at least 5 million units for each project globally. With the release of her next album appearing to come later this year, Nicki has a chance to further make a mark in the industry. Although album sales have become harder to come by as streaming sites have become the norm, the secretive nature of Minaj\u2019s upcoming project makes us wonder what could be up the rapper\u2019s sleeves.\n\nCongratulations Nicki on reaching such an impressive accomplishment.

Kim had been looking for a surrogate for months until recently when she found the perfect candidate,\u201d the source said. \u201cGiven her health scares in the past, Kim felt the need to hire a surrogacy agency that helped serve as the liaison in finding a healthy woman who would be a great surrogate option for her and Kanye. Both of them have been super involved in the process.\u201d Congrats to both Kim & Kanye!

Star constantly talked about her wedding on the morning talk show and their romance was all over the tabloids with rumors that Reynolds was not heterosexual.\n\nNow, Al Reynolds has officially come out to the folks over at RadarOnline.com. \u201cEver since I have been in the public eye, people have been speculating on my sexuality. And \u2018speculating\u2019 is a kind word for how it actually played out. With anger and disdain, people have been calling me out as gay, closeted, a sham and even nastier; much nastier.\u201d Reynolds explained why he was closeted, which is much more complex than fame or tabloids. He grew up in the Black church, which only made his struggles with sexuality more challenging, \u201cAs a Black man, that message and the hate and homophobia were multiplied to the ninth degree. I saw no path out that would resolve my personal feelings with my deeply held and ingrained religious beliefs.\u201d He added, \u201cThis internal dissonance was a powerful thing, like a cancer eating at one\u2019s soul. This resulted in some tough times \u2014 homelessness, unemployment, dependence on drugs and alcohol, public assistance, and, at the center of it all, a deep, deep shame and a feeling of unworthiness of the love of God. I didn\u2019t believe I deserved to live a good life, and I clearly didn\u2019t.\u201d Thankfully, Al has done the work within himself and said, \u201cToday I accept myself as a bisexual man. I have learned that sexual orientation is not binary, at least for me. I am capable of loving both sexes, and I have done both. My relationships, all of them, have been honest and based on my attraction to the other person. When I am in love I don\u2019t equivocate, nor do I waver.\u201d While people might want to mock Al and say this isn\u2019t a \u201cshocker,\u201d (Hell, even I joked about it) please remember outing someone or claiming to know their sexual orientation is never appropriate.

She went on to describe the rapper reaching around and asking her to stay behind the backstage area. Once in his dressing room, the rapper allegedly prodded at her clothing, attempted to kiss her, and forced her head down towards his erect penis, at which point the accuser leapt from the room altogether. This testimony was later transcribed and passed on to local authorities a few months after the incident.\n\nApart from the aforementioned statement by his lawyer, no other comment has been issued by Nelly\u2019s camp.

Today, Monique got on Instagram with a call to action. She requested that \u201cwe,\u201d the Black community, women, etc. boycott Netflix\u2026What an ask, right?\n\nIn a video she recently posted on her Instagram page, she explained why: \u201cHey my loves, I am asking that you stand with me and boycott Netflix for gender bias and color bias. I was offered a $500,000 deal last week to do a comedy special. However, Amy Schumer was offered $11 million, Chris Rock and Dave Chappelle, $20 million. Then Amy Schumer went back and renegotiated 2 more million dollars because she said, \u2018I shouldn\u2019t get what the men are getting, they\u2019re legends. However I should get more\u2019 and Netflix agreed.\n\nWhen we asked Netflix to explain the difference, why the money was so different, they said, \u2018Well, we believe that\u2019s what Monique will bring.\u2019 We said, \u2018What about my resume?\u2019 They said \u2018We don\u2019t go off of resumes.\u2019 Then we asked them, \u2018What was it about Amy Schumer?\u2019 and they said, \u2018Well, she sold out Madison Square Garden twice and she had a big movie over the summer.\u2019 Is that not Amy Schumer\u2019s resume? And then Netflix said, \u2018By the way, we believe Monique is a legend too.\u2019 Why shouldn\u2019t I get what the legends are getting? Please stand with me in this boycott of Neftlix. I love us for real.\u201d I have to admit Monique makes some valid points. Still, I can understand why Netflix might be apprehensive about giving Monique $13 million like they did for Schumer. If you ask me, on her worst day, Monique is funnier than Amy Schumer; still, she\u2019s not selling out arenas or writing and starring in blockbuster films. White folks love Amy Schumer right now, it\u2019s her time. Netflix was right, it\u2019s not about her resume (because Monique\u2019s would definitely be longer and more impressive, artistically speaking), it\u2019s about the money, baby.

In case you don\u2019t know, the frequently embattled ex-couple Nas and Kelis have been warring over child support for a minute now; as far as celebrity splits go, this one has been fraught with legal drama. It\u2019s unfortunate, especially given the genuine sentimentality Nas exhibited in Life Is Good closer \u201cBye Baby,\u201d but child support feuds can be a merciless affair. For now, at least, both Nas and Kelis were able to temporarily put aside their differences for the good of their eight year old son, Knight. According to TMZ, the exes have reportedly reached a settlement allowing joint custody.\n\nThe publication claims that Nas and Kelis will be sharing both legal and physical custody of Knight. The holidays have already been predetermined, with the example of Nas getting Father\u2019s Day and Kelis getting Mother\u2019s Day being given. The duo will also alternate birthdays, with Nas getting the even years and Kelis getting the odd ones. It\u2019s good to know that the artists were able to make this happen, and hopefully the same cooperation can continue when it comes time to revisit child support arrangements.\n\nAs of now, Nas has been contributing eight thousand a month toward the cause. Since Nas has also been securing the bag of late, Kelis feels he can afford to fork over a few extra ducats. The saga has yet to reach a conclusion.

Yet the Queens rapper has made no shortage of lucrative moves. As one of the founding members of Queensbridge Venture Partners, Nas has already made investments in several thriving companies like Lyft, Dropbox, Genius, and SeatGeek. Now, reports claim that Nas has secured yet another bag, and this one sounds absolutely massive.\n\nIn February, Amazon acquired a company called Ring, who make and sell video doorbells. According to Forbes, Ring was bought by Amazon for a reported $1.1 billion. As it happens, Nas was one of the first people to invest in Ring; as a result, the deal netted him over $40 Million, as reported by WeBuyBlack. Nas is apparently in good company, as none other than Shaquille O\u2019Neal also happened to be an investor in the company, agreeing to appear in Ring advertisements in exchange for an equity stake.\n\nSuffice it to say, Nas can add this one to his ever-growing list of accomplishments.

And that\u2019s the way Chicago is.\u201d At the same time, the rapper has seen how much his young daughter has grown and has begun weighing early education programs for her. \u201cThese are the two most pressing things on my mind: The thought of finally sending my daughter to school, and the unease of the city she\u2019s entering into.\u201d Get the FULL story and footage at www.itsKenBarbie.com "}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/72b176d563f68d30235551b40c25cd85/5B5A6AB7/t51.2885-15/e35/29414982_786795704859252_5194823074054144000_n.jpg", "tags": ["#HOTSHOTS", "#KimKardashian", "#OddaMagazine", "#kimkardashian", "#kimkardashianwest", "#kardashian", "#kardashians", "#keepingupwiththekardashians", "#kimye", "#kimk", "#kimmyk", "#northwest", "#chicagowest", "#saintwest"], "comments": 14, "likes": 718, "date": "2018-03-21T20:50:33.000Z", "description": ""}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/7760479ed6d10bc6bfe752a47bdb29a6/5B60E53F/t51.2885-15/e35/25037442_2090986794465331_3109099535352201216_n.jpg", "tags": ["#issarae", "#issa", "#insecure", "#insecurehbo", "#goldenglobes", "#goldenglobeawards"], "comments": 1, "likes": 658, "date": "2018-01-08T01:35:47.000Z", "description": "Come on through then, @issarae \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d "}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/8ee14cef73bbf9e531df4ec915d100dc/5B654277/t51.2885-15/e35/27878679_2000554476834752_2984935995079655424_n.jpg", "tags": ["#chyna", "#blac", "#blacchyna", "#angelawhite", "#angelakardashian", "#dreamkardashian", "#robkardashian", "#kardashian", "#kardashians", "#keepingupwiththekardashians", "#mechiesocrazy", "#mechi", "#entertainment", "#entertainmentblog", "#entertainmentnews", "#medi", "#gossip", "#gossipblog", "#celebrities", "#celebrityblogger", "#kenbarbie", "#itskenbarbie"], "comments": 19, "likes": 644, "date": "2018-02-21T18:27:10.000Z", "description": "Beyond reasonable explanation, Blac Chyna has gone about her daily life, and get this, she has yet to file a police report as of yet.

Nelly says he then invited her to join him and others back on his tour bus. He says they had consensual sex on the tour bus, and Greene only got mad when one of his performers, which he told police was a backup dancer, entered the room to use the bathroom. At that point, Nelly says Greene got \u201caggressive and disruptive\u201d and was asked to leave then. Greene called for an Uber and then called police to report the alleged incident which would eventually lead to Nelly\u2019s arrest for rape.\n\nFollowing his arrest though, Greene and her attorney made several statements on the Internet that falsely accused him of raping her. He says the statements were a clear and malicious attempt to get him prosecuted, which ultimately didn\u2019t work.\n\nIn addition, Nelly says her claims cost him a lot of money too.

Authorities from the Bergen County Sheriff\u2019s Department raided Winans home and arrested him without incident. The \u201cI Don\u2019t Wanna Know\u201d singer apparently owes $171,000 in back child support. Winans is currently in jail and his bail is set at the same amount of the child support owed.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time the 43-year-old singer has run afoul of the law. Last year, ironically around this same time, Winans plead guilty to two misdemeanor counts of failure to file tax returns. Prosecutors said that Winans failed to pay taxes on income from 2008 to 2012. He reportedly owes $434,968 in back taxes.\n\nWinans was already out on $250,000 bail in that case; he could get up to five years in prison if convicted. Reps for Mario Winans had no comment on the matter.

Although Lena Dunham has no issues finding herself in dramatic Hollywood storylines, this time Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s face-biter appears to have been none other than Sanaa Lathan.

TMZ\u2019s source is insisting that the bite was not aggressive in nature as Sanaa laid down a \u201cnoninvasive and playful\u201d bite. If you ask us, any type of biting is invasive but that\u2019s beyond the point. Although the bite was good-natured, it obviously caught the pop star off-guard.

Cymple Man says he handed Wiz Khalifa two copies of his song \u201cMost Of Us\u201d after he met him at an airport in Salt Lake City in 2012 with hopes he\u2019d be interested in collaborating.\n\nAccording to documents, Wiz never reached back out to him. Four years later, Wiz dropped his Khalifa compilation record with the song \u201cMost Of Us\u201d on it. Cymple claims the song \u201cunmistakably copies the essential elements.\u201d Now, Cymple is looking to sue Wiz for damages and wants him to stop using the song.\n\nAside from the lawsuit, Wiz Khalifa recently gave fans an update on his forthcoming album Rolling Papers 2. The rapper was initially slated to release it before the end of 2017 but obviously, that didn\u2019t occur. However, he did say that he\u2019s been writing some \u201camazing songs lately.\u201d In addition, he also dropped off a new song \u201cCaptain\u201d earlier today. There\u2019s no confirmation that it\u2019ll end up on his album but it\u2019s definitely a dope single to hold us over.\n\nListen to Cymple Man and Wiz Khalifa\u2019s songs at www.itsKenBarbie.com let us know if you think they sound similar?

Police are also seeking to find footage from 1Oak that evening.\n\nSince news broke earlier this morning, the police are looking to speak to Takeoff, Offset and Quavo about the situation as well as their manager. However, it\u2019s been confirmed that Offset and Takeoff weren\u2019t involved in the scuffle. Quavo nor any of the other members of the Migos have addressed the accusations.\n\nNYPD also wants to review security cam footage from 1Oak as well. So we\u2019ll have to wait and find out what happens.\n\nEric The Jeweler is a pretty big name in the industry though, having over 90K followers on Instagram and made pieces for Snoop Dogg, 50 Cent, French Montana and more in the past.\n\nWe\u2019ll continue to keep you posted as more on this story develops at www.itsKenBarbie.com "}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/e7a7b55e6f3b12a695b445cf173b615d/5B65654B/t51.2885-15/e35/30589994_839729226213988_525624265257517056_n.jpg", "tags": ["#khloe", "#khloekardashian", "#itsagirl", "#congratulations", "#kardashian", "#kardashians", "#keepingupwiththekardashians", "#tristan", "#thompson", "#tristanthompson", "#cheating", "#entertainment", "#khlo", "#goodamerican", "#entertainmentblog", "#gossip", "#celebrities", "#celebrityblogger", "#kenbarbie", "#itskenbarbie"], "comments": 24, "likes": 1029, "date": "2018-04-12T21:54:31.000Z", "description": "\u201cLittle Mama\u201d is finally here!\n\nKhloe Kardashian has officially welcomed her first baby girl into the world, TMZ reports. The mother of one reportedly welcomed her first child Thursday morning around 4 AM at a hospital just outside of Cleveland. Kourtney, Kim, Kris and Khloe\u2019s best friend Malika was said to be there for her special moment.\n\nThe little one has yet to have a name and we\u2019re sure that a fury of fans are tweeting suggestions and speculations, the same way the Twitterverse did for baby Chicago.\n\nAll this news comes in the middle of a tumultuous time for Khloe as the father of her Aries baby, Tristan Thompson, just got caught cheating on her. The one video of him kissing a girl in New York this past weekend led to the second video of him kissing other women. \u201cShe will obviously never be able to trust Tristan again or look at him the same way,\u201d a source close to the family recently revealed. \u201cHer world is shattered. She is in complete disbelief that this is happening. The family absolutely believes it\u2019s in Khloe\u2019s best interest to end the relationship but will support her either way.\u201d The source added how Khloe moved to Cleveland not just to be closer to Tristan, but also so \u201csomething like this wouldn\u2019t happen.\u201d Though it is probably bittersweet, Congratulations to Khloe.

Terry Mango emerged from the sunken place and broke her silence about the matter via social media, essentially telling everyone to stop bringing the matter to her doorstep.\n\nMango, who is of Kenya descent and resides in Sweden where H&M is based, replied via Facebook to the chatter surrounding the ad. In so many words, Mango felt that the response to her son modeling the hoodie was over the top and had a slight message for the critics. \u201cStop crying wolf all the time. Unnecessary issue here, get over it,\u201d Mango wrote. When pressed on if she understood the reasons why people were angered, Mango doubled down and said she understood but was still largely unmoved.\n\nMango is certainly entitled to her opinion and yes, this is her son folks are talking about. However, while she might not see the problem, the ad itself is problematic and there\u2019s nothing wrong with pointing that out.\n\nBest believe if her son makes it big in the fashion world that he\u2019ll have to contend with far more racism being a child with dark skin. If there\u2019s some kind of utopia Mango lives in where that isn\u2019t the case, she needs to hand over the directions pronto.

Each week, some sort of new development added to the saga. Today, TMZ has reported that Usher has denied any wrongdoing to the judge and also told the court that all of the accusers are liars.\n\nWhile there has yet to be an official response from Usher, or at least a public one, Usher\u2019s legal team has just responded to the California herpes lawsuit. His lawyers are denying all allegations held against him and more specifically, he\u2019s denying ever having sexual contact with them and emphasizing that he definitely did not give them herpes.\n\nWhile earlier in the case, Usher had reportedly said that they assumed the risk of getting an STD by not using protection knowingly, he\u2019s taking this argument even further in court. The singer has also told the court that the three individuals accusing him of giving them herpes don\u2019t have any legal claim saying that anything that he did was unintentional and if he did have herpes, he wasn\u2019t aware of it. He\u2019s also claiming through his lawyers that the accusers have \u201cunclean hands\u201d however, they aren\u2019t specifying exactly what the accusers did wrong.\nWhile his accusers have come out of the woodwork to drag the \u201cLet It Burn\u201d singer\u2019s name through the mud, Usher has been denying each claim since. Yesterday, Quantasia Sharpton made a claim that there is video evidence that Usher and herself had sex however, that theory got quickly de-bunked shortly afterwards by her lawyer Lisa Bloom. She\u2019s been the most public accuser thusfar but has also been the quickest to have her credibility shot down. Who knows where this case will go at this point but by the sounds of it, Usher\u2019s clearly keeping to his story much better than Sharpton.\n\nAs this Usher saga continues to unravel, it doesn\u2019t seem to be stopping Usher in any way. He was recently seen in the studio with Jermaine Dupri and Bryan-Michael Cox and is clearly not letting the accusations stop him from putting in work at the studio.\n\nWe\u2019ll be keeping you updated as the story develops further at www.itsKenBarbie.com "}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/47b0e0f471f4e48d52c4f5d327a8cdf7/5B5F6BA7/t51.2885-15/e35/26282735_179328619496687_1732840440022958080_n.jpg", "tags": ["#liluzivert", "#liluzi", "#lilwayne", "#wayne", "#weezy", "#tunchi", "#lilweezy", "#cashmoney", "#youngmoney", "#fatjoe", "#entertainment", "#entertainmentnews", "#entertainmentblog", "#gossip", "#gossipblog", "#gossipblogger", "#celebrities", "#celebrityblogger", "#kenbarbie", "#itskenbarbie"], "comments": 25, "likes": 442, "date": "2018-01-24T03:30:13.000Z", "description": "There\u2019s no doubt that Lil Wayne had one of the most influential runs in hip hop within the past ten years. Through his fashion, his style of rapping, his overall presence in the rap game, he made a major shift in the rap game that\u2019s evident with all the new rappers coming out these days. Fat Joe recently spoke to Ebro on his Beats1 show where he spoke on the Lil Uzi Vert and Lil Wayne comparison.\n\nFat Joe has always shown love to Lil Wayne and the two have worked with each other on several occasions. In his recent interview, Fat Joe spoke on Weezy\u2019s influence on the new generation of hip hop. He said that all the new rapper\u2019s emerging right now have adopted Wayne\u2019s flow in some sort of capacity. \u201cWhen you hear all these little kids now doing hip hop, those is all Lil Wayne flows. Every last one,\u201d he told Ebro, \u201cLil Uzi is a bad version of Lil Wayne. It\u2019s not as good as Lil Wayne, I\u2019mma just be honest with you. And he\u2019s good. I like his songs.\u201d Joe further elaborated on his comments which he says aren\u2019t meant to be malicious in any way. He shows love to Uzi and says that he has nothing but love for him but the comparison between himself and Lil Wayne aren\u2019t accurate. \u201cLil Uzi, I have nothing but love for you. He ain\u2019t as good as Lil Wayne. That\u2019s impossible,\u201d he said, \u201cLil Wayne was lyrically considered the best rapper on earth for a couple of years. Lil Uzi ain\u2019t going to get that. It\u2019s with no disrespect because I like Lil Uzi Vert and I like a lot of his records. I cannot front. I actually bought his album.\u201d Fat Joe made it clear that he isn\u2019t trying to disrespect Lil Uzi Vert or his artistry in any way but his point is ultimately, Lil Wayne helped spark this new generation\u2019s sound.\n\nWhat do you all think?

But she actually was covering for the real culprit, her son Shawn (McKinley Freeman). The series was set behind the scenes of a long-running daytime television show, chronicling the fireworks that erupt daily between the five female co-hosts. Onscreen, they are best friends with five very different points of view, but behind the scenes, they inhabit a world of power struggles, cat fights and cocktails.\n\nI actually thoroughly enjoyed the series, but I will say I never really heard much chatter about it.

Price was found dead in April, 2016, and his cause of death was believed to be due to counterfeit Vicodin pills containing lethal amounts of Fentanyl, an incredibly powerful opioid.\n\nNow, according to the New York Times, Price\u2019s family will be suing an Illinois hospital, as well as the pharmacy chain, Walgreens, for playing a direct part in Prince\u2019s death two years ago.\n\nThe suit alleges that Prince received improper care during his stay in the Trinity Medical Center, a Moline, Illinois, hospital where he was treated for a drug overdose days before his death. The lawsuit claims that his death was a \u201cdirect and proximate cause\u201d of the hospital failing to properly identify the causes and administer proper treatment for his overdose.\n\nAfter his plane made an emergency landing, Prince was brought to the hospital, where his bodyguard, Kirk Johnson, told doctors that he may have taken Percocet. The doctors who treated him didn\u2019t believe him, as it required a higher dose of Narcan, a drug used to counteract opioid overdoses, to revive him than would be necessary with Percocet. However, the hospital allowed Prince to leave after his revival, despite his refusal to undergo any sort of testing.\n\nWalgreens is also named in the suit, for allegedly \u201cdispensing narcotic prescription medications\u201d without a proper purpose, and for failing to conduct a thorough drug utilization review.\n\nPrince\u2019s family\u2019s lawyers said in a statement Monday, \u201cWhat happened to Prince is happening to families across America.

Brandy and her mother took the tweet as a diss to Ray and told her to apologize.\n\nPrincess got pissed and told them to stay out of their relationship.

While many are content to wild out on camera in the hopes of going viral, there are some who take things too far, opting to break the law for a perceived greater good. Such was the case for aspiring rapper Cedric Miller, who recently found himself arrested after attempting to rob a Memphis Wingstop. His motivation was a simple one \u2013 to get the attention of the restaurant\u2019s owner, rapper Rick Ross. Unfortunately for Miller, his attempted robbery was unsuccessful, as reported by CBS\u2019s local Memphis outlet.\n\nSurveillance footage reveals Miller and his crew attempting to seize money from the Wingstop. While they managed to get away, police received a tip naming Miller as one of the robbers. Afterward, a Wingstop employee was able to identify Miller out of a lineup, and he was arrested shortly thereafter. Police then went on to inform the Wingstop manager that Miller\u2019s motive was to get Rick Ross\u2019 attention, in the hopes of landing a record deal with the mogul. And while it seems unlikely that Rozay will actually sign the now-incarcerated Miller, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if the story actually managed to spread to the boss. On that note, Ross has yet to comment on the robbery, and it\u2019s unclear if he ever will.\n\nCheck out video of the report, including some footage from the robbery at www.itsKenBarbie.com "}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/a0745ebd1037cbadf470d52ea99dcb9d/5B9D4311/t51.2885-15/e35/27580830_1929589040690514_5431421934648688640_n.jpg", "tags": ["#formation"], "comments": 4, "likes": 506, "date": "2018-02-04T22:02:00.000Z", "description": "Okay ladies, now let\u2019s get in "}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/f69c083a2da42a4d6d909ee36915e983/5B7A1C24/t51.2885-15/e35/25016973_130142411104830_918639048724054016_n.jpg", "tags": ["#power", "#starzpower", "#starz", "#50cent", "#50", "#ghost", "#freeghost", "#entertainment", "#entertainmentnews", "#media", "#gossip", "#gossipblog", "#rumors", "#coverage", "#celebrities", "#celebrityblogger", "#kenbarbie", "#itskenbarbie"], "comments": 0, "likes": 314, "date": "2017-08-03T21:27:35.000Z", "description": "50 Cent is NOT happy with the way Starz is handling his critically acclaimed show Power, and he is threatening to leave and/or take the series elsewhere if network execs don\u2019t get their act together soon.\n\nFollowing Sunday night\u2019s explosive episode, in which two major characters were killed\u2014Jukebox (Anika Noni Rose) and Julio (J.R.

Kanye and his touring company aren\u2019t getting paid because Lloyd\u2019s of London believes Kanye\u2019s breakdown, which ended the tour early, was fueled by prescription drugs and illegal drugs and therefore was his own fault.\n\nThen just a few weeks after that, Lloyd\u2019s Of London decided to flip the script and countersue the Very Good Touring company. Lloyd\u2019s said that insufficient information was delivered to them in order to determine whether to cover his losses or not after the tour cancellation was announced.\n\nHowever it appears all that back & forth legal action has been finally put to rest. According to TMZ, Kanye & his touring company have settled the lawsuits. Lloyd\u2019s apparently couldn\u2019t handle the pressure by Kanye\u2019s lawyers and therefore agreed to pay most of what Kanye was due under the policy, which we know was nearly $10 million. They figured going to court was too big of a risk, especially when faced with a possible huge punitive damages award.

Tina Lawson recently took to Instagram to admit that she was \u201cafraid\u201d of what her eldest daughter had planned for her headlining act. Needless to say, she now stands corrected. \u201cI told Beyonc\u00e9 that I was afraid that the predominately white audience at Coachella would be confused by all of the black culture and Black college culture because it was something that they might not get,\u201d she said in her post. \u201cHer brave response to me made me feel a-bit selfish and ashamed. She said I have worked very hard to get to the point where I have a true voice and At this point in my life and my career I have a responsibility to do whats best for the world and not what is most popular.\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 did just that. Her performance had 100 dancers, students from Historically Black Colleges and Universities and as the post below suggests, she even brought some Wakanada vibes.\n\nAfter her set at the festival, Beyonce announced that she will be donating $100,000 To HBCU through her BeyGOOD initiative.

Kelly is no stranger to the controversy and despite the heinous allegations he\u2019s faced over his career, he\u2019s still managed to prosper in his career with a smile on his face. However, there always seems to be more stories that emerge every time he dodges a bullet. Most recently, the singer allegedly gave an STD to a sexual assault victim. This came shortly after he was accused of training a fourteen year old girl into being his sex pet. His daughter recently chimed in on the situation and it\u2019s clear that she doesn\u2019t endorse anything her father\u2019s being accused of.\n\nJoann Kelly a.k.a Buku was recently approached by TMZ in Atlanta earlier today where she spoke on the accusations against her father. For Buku, it\u2019s clear that the scenario is weighing heavy on her as she admitted she doesn\u2019t speak about the allegations against R. Kelly too much. \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t have much of a comment. It\u2019s very close to my heart. It\u2019s hard because it\u2019s family matters, you know?\u201d She explained. \u201cOverall, it\u2019s hard. I try not to speak about it too much. It is what it is. I feel terrible.\u201d She was later asked whether she was close with her father. She said that despite everything, they\u2019re still family and they\u2019re going to \u201cdeal with each other.\u201d R. Kelly\u2019s current allegations have been the final straw for many people on his team.

According to TMZ, the MMG rapper could potentially be heading back to prison for a near 2 year stint after his latest probation violations.\n\nIf you remember, Meek was arrested for getting into a fight at a St. Louis airport back in March, and then again in August for his reckless driving of his four wheelers in NYC. While both of those arrests ended up getting dropped and he took a plea deal, they did ultimately violate his drug & weapon case, which apparently can land him back in prison reports claim.\n\nMeek is scheduled for a court hearing this upcoming Monday (11/6) for the two probation violations, and the judge made it clear in the past that he\u2019s not playing around with Meek. Back in 2015, Meek left Pennsylvania for a show without getting approval from the court and the judge ended up putting him on house arrest as a result. And considering these two recent arrests this year are even bigger than the travel issue, who knows what the judge will throw at him this time.\n\nMeek could face up to 20 months in prison for the violation, but that\u2019s apparently worse case scenario. However, Meek\u2019s luck with the law has been pretty good this year, so something tells me he won\u2019t be heading back to prison.\n\nThis latest report comes just days after finding out Meek\u2019s airport assault case was dropped. Meek & his lawyers struck a deal with prosecutors to have the case dismissed if he completed community service, and after serving his hours at Philadelphia\u2019s Veterans Association, the case was fortunately dismissed already.\n\nWe\u2019ll keep you posted come next week if any further developments happen in court at www.itsKenBarbie.com "}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/6789197e1747a723f739e57d5fc0a69c/5B9B5C62/t51.2885-15/e35/30077971_1635924629826410_2729406366048321536_n.jpg", "tags": ["#trey", "#songz", "#treysongz", "#trigga", "#tre", "#mrstealyourgirl", "#tremaine", "#tremaineneverson", "#yurp", "#entertainment", "#entertainmentblog", "#gossip", "#celebrities", "#celebrityblogger", "#kenbarbie", "#itskenbarbie"], "comments": 25, "likes": 703, "date": "2018-04-09T18:47:19.000Z", "description": "Trey Songz can rest a little easier, as he apparently will not be facing felony prosecution for his alleged beating of Andrea Buera in a nightclub over NBA All-Star Weekend.\n\nAccording to TMZ, the L.A. District attorney wasn\u2019t convinced about the validity of the case, leading to the felony charges being dropped against the singer.\n\nSongz\u2019s lawyer reportedly presented several eye-witness statements that contradicted the statements given by Buera, as well as other info damaging to Buera\u2019s credibility.\n\nThe assault was first reported back in February, with Buera giving a press conference with her side of the story in early March, where she claimed that he beat her so badly that she had to be sent to the hospital. She also confirmed that she had received a temporary restraining order against Songz. Since then, Songz was forced to turn himself in to police, and was released from jail on a $50,000 bond. In his sole statement on the situation, Songz claimed that he was \u201cbeing lied on and falsely accused for someone\u2019s personal gain.\u201d Despite gaining support from other artists such as 50 Cent, who called the accusations a \u201cmoney play,\u201d Songz still has several accusations against him from multiple women.\n\nHowever, in this instance it appears he\u2019s gotten off easy. Songz still isn\u2019t off the hook yet, as his case is now being referred to the L.A. City Attorney, who can still charge him with the lesser crime of misdemeanor domestic violence.\n\nWe\u2019ll keep you up to date with any more news about the case at www.itsKenBarbie.com "}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/7f009e7580dd075a4e930607419a9ef3/5B9AC4D6/t51.2885-15/e35/29093471_349856675509654_5680000313730269184_n.jpg", "tags": [], "comments": 18, "likes": 1083, "date": "2018-03-17T21:54:22.000Z", "description": "\ud83e\udd18 \ud83c\udfc8 TOUCHDOWN BIH. \ud83d\ude1b"}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/52f45d174528439207c423910222d64c/5B61AFD8/t51.2885-15/e35/25013217_170253607055275_5755632643408396288_n.jpg", "tags": ["#beyonc", "#beyonce", "#yonce", "#yonc", "#beysus", "#formation", "#beehive", "#bey", "#behive", "#jayz", "#444", "#hov", "#ontherun", "#beyhive", "#entertainment", "#entertainmentnews", "#entertainmentblog", "#gossip", "#gossipblog", "#gossipblogger", "#celebritynews", "#celebrityblogger", "#celebrities", "#kenbarbie", "#itskenbarbie"], "comments": 3, "likes": 572, "date": "2017-11-29T22:49:01.000Z", "description": "In a new interview for T Magazine\u2019s holiday issue, JAY-Z has confirmed the long-circulating rumors that he and Beyonc\u00e9 had been working on a collaborative album during the making of their respective releases 4:44 and Lemonade.

There was never a point where it was like, \u2018I\u2019m making this album.\u2019 I was right there the entire time.\u201d As for the way things did turn out, he admitted that the release of both Lemonade and 4:44, his album which was widely seen as his response to the former, caused pain for both of them and made them \u201cvery, very uncomfortable.\u201d Still, he said, \u201cthe best place is right in the middle of the pain. And that\u2019s where we were sitting. And it was uncomfortable. And we had a lot of conversations. You know. [I was] really proud of the music she made, and she was really proud of the art I released. And, you know, at the end of the day we really have a healthy respect for one another\u2019s craft.

Last night\u2019s episode from the natural chemistry to the punchlines, was perfect. I also believe Tiffany still has a great relationship with her original television home at VH1 so I wouldn\u2019t be at all surprised to see this picked up as a late night talk show on the network. Needless to say, I think the battle is over. We\u2019ve got a winning combo. What do you guys think? Do you want to see New York stick around permanently?

Brown also said justice still hasn\u2019t been served in the July 2015 death of his daughter Bobbi Kristina, as Nick Gordon -- found \u201clegally responsible\u201d -- is still free. \"No, not yet. Because he's still walking around free,\" said Brown when asked if he feels justice was gained after Gordon was ordered by a court to pay $36 million to the estate of his former girlfriend after he was found him liable for her death.\n\nAdded Brown of what would bring him peace: \"If he was locked up somewhere where somebody can rape him. That's just how I feel. He raped me by taking my daughter away.\" The former New Edition member begins shooting The Bobby Brown Story miniseries next week, airing this fall on BET.

Still, that doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t progress to be made. \u201cChyna is pleased that Rob has agreed to peacefully coparent Dream with her, as she has been requesting all along,\u201d Chyna\u2019s attorney, Lisa Bloom, told the folks over at People. \u201cBecause Rob agreed to continue to stay away from Chyna and not contact her, Chyna has agreed to take the domestic abuse hearing scheduled for Monday, Sept. 18, off calendar. She will always have the right to go back into court if further incidents of domestic abuse occur.\u201d According to TMZ, Chyna will receive $20K a month in child support from Kardashian.\n\nIn a sit-down with People in July, Chyna \u2014 who also shares a son King Cairo, 4, with the rapper Tyga \u2014 maintained she\u2019s committed to \u201cco-parenting\u201d with Kardashian.\n\nWith that said, Bloom revealed that \u201cthis agreement does not resolve all disputes between Chyna and Rob.\u201d In fact, Kardashian could pay even bigger for his little meltdown, in which he violated California\u2019s revenge porn laws, when he shared graphic and expletive-ridden content about his ex \u2014 including three nude photos \u2014 while accusing her of drug use, alcohol abuse and infidelity.\n\nTMZ reports that the former \u201cRob and Blac\u201d star is determined to hit Kardashian below the belt, in the form of 7 figures. An insider close to the situation tells the entertainment news outlet that the model is still fuming over losing a series of weight-loss endorsements due to the pics, which made it clear that she\u2019s gone under the knife (apparently, the companies wanted au naturel).

It may seem like a great idea, considering the rapper recently dropped his 13th studio album, but the only problem with that plan is that Jay is not on board. According to a new report, the Brooklyn native has allegedly turned down the offer to play at halftime.\n\nWhile it was never confirmed, Hov was rumored to perform alongside longtime collaborator Justin Timberlake at the fall game. \u201cLots of people have been saying Jay will perform with Justin Timberlake, but it is simply not the case,\u201d an insider said according to Metro. \u201cHe has enough songs to create an incredible performance, but he really has no plans to do the halftime show.\u201d Jay\u2019s allegedly declining the NFL\u2019s offer comes briefly after the rapper announced his support of Colin Kaepernick at the 2017 Meadows Music & Art Festival. Jigga dedicated his song \u201cThe Story of O.J.\u201d to Kaepernick, who has been blackballed by the league following his national-anthem protest. \u201cI want to dedicate this song to Colin Kaepernick tonight\u2026 I want to dedicate this song to anybody that was held back and you overcame whatever it was,\u201d JAY-Z stated during his set on Sept. 15. It\u2019s unclear whether JAY-Z\u2019s actions had anything to do with Kaepernick, but it wouldn\u2019t be the first time the artist has taken a stand in the name of politics or a social movement.\n\nIf the reports are true, it looks like the search is still on for another performer.

While the likes of Nicki Minaj and Missy Elliott are congratulating Cardi B for becoming the first solo female rapper to have a No. 1 song on Billboard\u2019s Hot 100 in nearly 20 years, there\u2019s one female rapper who\u2019s pouting in the corner.\n\nAzealia Banks, a rapper who has become more known for her controversial comments and skin bleaching than for her music, was not feeling the Cardi B love. In a series of now-deleted tweets on Monday (Sept. 25), she called the \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d emcee a \u201cpoor man\u2019s Nicki [Minaj].\u201d The salty rapper ranted that black men in the hip-hop industry never rooted for her, Minaj, or Remy Ma in the way they\u2019re celebrating Cardi\u2014who Banks believes is Latina and not black. Banks even argues that culture influencers like Charlamagne tha God should have helped her way before giving Cardi an opportunity. You can catch a screenshot of that now deleted rant in the FULL STORY.\n\nThough she deleted the original rant, Banks has continued to tweet. Despite her overall negativity, she wants people in the industry\u2014particularly black men\u2014to recognize her hard work instead of \u201ccarrying\u201d newcomers like Cardi. \u201cThey think my suffering is funny\u2026 I rap my ass off,\u201d she wrote.\n\nIt would probably be in Azealia Banks\u2019 best interest to drop the negativity and hate and just focus on making quality music. She clearly measures success based on mainstream acceptance and approval, but this doesn\u2019t happen for everyone. There are plenty of artists who never hit No. 1 on the Hot 100, but still make good music and have a loyal fan base.\n\nUnfortunately, she craves attention more and chooses to go on petty and controversial rants. I hope she eventually finds peace\u2026 I just hope at that point it\u2019s not too late for success.

After starting the note off by hoping he doesn\u2019t take offense, Chavarria says she has bad credit and couldn\u2019t get enough money together for her son\u2019s tuition for his last semester at Virginia Commonwealth University. \u201cThis will probably be my son\u2019s last semester at VCU if the tuition isn\u2019t paid for this year and unfortunately with my bad credit, I am unable to secure a loan or cosign a loan for my son,\u201d she wrote in the note. \u201cAnything you can do is very much appreciated.\u201d She then added, \u201cEvery little helps \u2014 please donate what you can to keep him attending VCU.\u201d Chavarria even admitted to slipping Meek the note, and said the judge wasn\u2019t aware of her action. She believed that since Meek\u2019s from Philly and so is she, he might help out. Of course, Meek didn\u2019t give her any money, but she says he son still managed to stay in school despite her ballsy favor.\n\nThis news comes while the judge who sentenced Meek is currently under fire for asking the Philly rapper to record a song for her, and to hire her friend at Roc Nation.

Evidently, a report from TMZ has confirmed what the more logical mind suspected. Nicki Minaj, a musician, was taking a break from the noise to work on her music. Apparently, Nicki feels as if a social media presence actually hinders her creativity, and opted to throw herself into her art without any distractions.\n\nIt would appear that Nicki Minaj is in good company. The Queens icon has been spotted with Lil Wayne, who recently underwent a renaissance of late, proving on songs like \u201cBig Bad Wolf\u201d that he can still outrap at least ninety-five percent of the game well into the tail end of his career.

Things apparently went south after the duo had a Skype interview scheduled with Mo\u2019Nique about her history with gender bias (most recently with Netflix) and when technical difficulties made the interview not go through, forcing T.S. and Khia to have some behind the scenes words, things didn\u2019t end well.

After the live fight made its rounds on the internet, and Khia decided to make some not so nice accusations, T.S. has recently hopped online to share a video of her side of the story and shared an interesting tidbit of information about Nicki Minaj.\n\nT.S. starts the video off with \u201cbottom line, we dealing with facts,\u201d where she calls Khia out for accusing her of stealing the Queen\u2019s Court trademark. Rightfully clearing her name of any wrongdoing, T.S. explained that their podcast was getting so big that Nicki Minaj contacted with interest in a doing a show. \u201cOn April 21, 2017, at 4:30 a.m. Nicki Minaj hit me in my inbox,\u201d Madison said. \u201cNicki Minaj said to me, \u2018Hi, are you and Khia interested in doing TV? Send your contact number.\u2019\u201d Watch T.S. share her side of the story at www.itsKenBarbie.com. What\u2019s your take on the situation? I personally just want the two to get back together and for all of this to go away.

Since I don\u2019t prefer either of them, what can I find that would make me vote? And some of Donald Trump\u2019s views on Christianity, honestly, is what caused me to vote for him.\u201d Campbell apparently failed to actually take a good look at Trump and his beliefs. Because Trump\u2019s actions before and after he was elected president has been far from what it means to be Christian. A true Christian would not boast about sexually predatory behavior. A true Christian would not support White supremacists and uphold those views by discriminating against Blacks when it comes to housing.

Meanwhile, Asian Doll went on the offensive, recounting how Rico Nasty only attempted to scratch her during the fight and how, at the end of the day, one of them showed weakness and it wasn\u2019t her. \u201cYou hit the floor in 6secs within the fight your nigga jumped in & got rocked,\u201d he wrote later in a now-deleted Twitter post.

Consistently speaking her mind, the rapper always comes up with ways to make headlines. Unfortunately, most of those headlines have zero to do with her musical career. Her past has been riddled with controversy, from criminal charges to outlandish claims, Banks always has something up her sleeve. A master at garnering attention, all Azealia had to do this time was type up a quick statement on Rihanna\u2019s album and make some more boisterous claims about her influence among female rappers.\n\nWhile Azealia has proven herself to be a consistent talent, she took to her Instagram account to claim she was the most influential female rapper, post-Nicki Minaj. The statement is unquestionably bold and her explanation is surprisingly coherent as she claims that when she says something, there is always a public reaction. Banks continued by writing, \u201cI can 100% see the impact I\u2019ve had on female rap culture. It makes me know that I\u2019m not, and was never crazy. I\u2019m happy to contribute to the arts in whatever way I can. Even if people don\u2019t give me the credit\u2026\u201d In a different comment, Banks says that Rihanna named her album Anti following Azealia\u2019s suggestions.\n\nPeople continually bash Azealia for voicing her opinions, critiquing her mental health and calling her names but, in her own way, she is making sense here. While she may not be the most popular female rapper since Nicki (that goes to Cardi B,) Azealia Banks has continually influenced headlines for the last six years due to her antics.

The project exceeded critical expectations and is on the road to making a huge mark commercially. The \u201cBe Careful\u201d rapper\u2019s expected album sales are nearing 250K within it\u2019s first week. At this point, it seems inevitable that it\u2019ll debut at the top of the charts. That\u2019ll be confirmed later this weekend, however, she\u2019s already made a mark in the streaming world.\n\nCardi B has taken the crown from Taylor Swift\u2019s previously held record on Apple Music, Variety reports. The \u201cDrip\u201d rapper has reportedly earned over 100 million streams within it\u2019s first week which doubles on Swift\u2019s previously held records. This now makes Cardi\u2019s Invasion Of Privacy the most streamed album from a female artist within the first week. In addition, she already doubled Taylor\u2019s record within the first half of the week.\n\nCardi\u2019s reign on the streaming platform also makes Invasion Of Privacy the fifth most streamed album on Apple Music\u2019s worldwide chart.

Hazel returned with a new man by her side, a 25 year-old aspiring rapper who goes by the name of Rose Burgandy. However, according to sources, things may not be that simple in the dating life of Ms. Hazel E.\n\nWhile, Hazel hasn\u2019t necessarily kept her romance with Burgandy a secret, a source very close to pairs inner circle (who prefers to not be revealed at this time) has EXCLUSIVELY revealed to itsKenBarbie.com that Hazel has been secretly creeping with cast mate Keyshia Cole\u2019s estranged husband Daniel \u2018Boobie\u2019 Gibson, who is also appearing on this season of \u2018Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood.\u2019 This is interesting as Gibson openly still lives with Cole in her home, as shared on the show, for both co-parenting and financial reasons. Also, in recent interviews Keyshia Cole has hinted that her estranged relationship with Gibson may now be in a different place, but viewers will have to keep watching the show to see how it plays out. Who knows, that could be a good or bad different place. I\u2019d imagine if Keyshia knows he\u2019s smashing Hazel, this could cause a left turn.\n\nHazel and Rose Burgandy have been dating for the last year which is interesting itself, since it apparently began while Hazel was still in a relationship with comedian Katt Williams. Do your thing, girl.\n\nAccording to the source, the few people who are aware of the secret smashing between Boobie and Hazel are not fond of it, as the source even went as far as calling Hazel an \u201cover aged hoe, and needs to grow up.\u201d Get the FULL tea at www.itsKenBarbie.com\n"}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/b8220f2f6293a368513323d8a06da87b/5B9C221B/t51.2885-15/e35/31070317_142957396551411_3508242446876147712_n.jpg", "tags": ["#nick", "#nickelodeon", "#90skid", "#doubledare", "#entertainment", "#entertainmentblog", "#gossip", "#celebrities", "#celebrityblogger", "#kenbarbie", "#itskenbarbie"], "comments": 3, "likes": 288, "date": "2018-04-27T00:32:49.000Z", "description": "The throwback series is making a comeback.\n\nNickelodeon\u202c knows what their audience wants.

Hosted by \u202aMarc Summers\u202c\u202c, the series featured two teams of four competing in hilarious physical events and answering mind-boggling questions in order to win prizes. The series went on to inspire the creation of other classic Nickelodeon\u202c game shows like Legends of the Hidden Temple and Wild & Crazy Kids, and now, Double Dare is set to return to television.\n\nAccording to The New York Post, Double Dare will be rebooted this summer with an expansive 40 episode season, and will feature many familiar challenges such as the human hamster wheel, the insane and hilarious obstacle course, and the enormous nose picking activity. Some throwback guest will also appear on the show, and new celebrities will also be featured in the reboot. Now if only Nickelodeon\u202c would bring back shows like My Brother and Me, Salute Your Shorts, The Adventures of Pete & Pete, and The Journey of Allen Strange, then 90\u2019s babies would be set for life.\n\nWill you be turning in?

Word on the street is that Gucci Mane\u2019s new wife Keyshia Ka\u2019oir, for reasons unknown, has \u201csecret children\u201d and she\u2019s supposedly hiding them somewhere in Jamaica.\n\nAs Keyshia Ka\u2019oir was preparing for the biggest day of her life\u2014her wedding to the trap god we know and love as Gucci Mane\u2014rumors were resurfacing regarding the former video vixen\u2019s past.\n\nAccording to the rumor mill, Keyshia has three children from previous relationships (a teenager, one currently in middle school and another in elementary school) that she practically abandoned in her home country Jamaica in order to pursue a career in music and modeling here in the United States.\n\nWord is she doesn\u2019t really publicly acknowledge her kidsbecause she doesn\u2019t want people to know that she (allegedly) doesn\u2019t take care them, or at the very least, left them in another country for someone else (her mother, according to rumors) to raise them while she lives her life child-free in the U.S.\n\nThe rumors have been swirling for several years, but they have picked back up more recently due to Keyshia\u2019s upcoming \u201cMane Event\u201d wedding special with Gucci Mane, which aired last night.\n\nSo where are Keyshia Ka\u2019oir\u2019s kids? Does she even HAVE three kids? Are they really living in Jamaica with her parents? And why is she hiding them from the world? So many questions, and not enough answers.\n\nThere\u2019s a video floating around on social media (above) showing Keyshia briefly talking about her daughter on \u201cThe Real,\u201d but she didn\u2019t mention any other kids.\n\nAt the moment, there are no confirmed reports from any credible sources that Keyshia even has three children that she\u2019s \u201chiding\u201d from us.\n\nFor the record, multiple other blogs did put out that Keyshia Ka\u2019oir does, in fact, have kids, but we\u2019re still waiting on that confirmation from Mrs Davis.

October 17, 1989 was the day of Quintanilla\u2019s first studio album release, Selena; one that would lead to five more albums, the last of which would be released posthumously and become her first No.1 on the Billboard 200. \u201cI grew up as the daughter of a Mexican immigrant single mom living in a small (primarily white) town outside of Fort Worth, Texas,\u201d Perla Campos, Global Marketing Lead for Google Doodles and project manager for the Selena Quintanilla Google Doodle told the folks over at Billboard. \u201cThere were always two women who taught me I could do anything and be anything I set my mind to: my mom and Selena. Selena has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember.\u201d Both Campos and Quintanilla grew up in similar situations. Both were raised in Mexican families in small towns in Texas. Both were women who, despite the societal constraints regarding what it meant to be a Hispanic woman in a white community, managed to beat the odds.

Aside from his current case, it seems like he has a lot of people in the streets who aren\u2019t the biggest fans of him. There\u2019s been several events where things seemed to have gone left due to the budding rapper\u2019s presence including at Yams Day a few weeks back. However, during this past weekend, 6ix9ine seemed to have some sort of run-in with some people in Minnesota that seemed to ruin his Super Bowl weekend.\n\nOver the weekend, 6ix9ine seemed to have a slew of issues in Minnesota. The rapper was seen in a physical altercation outside of the venue of his show. The footage shown ended in gun shots with people dispersing the area afterwards. However, Tekashi 6ix9ine didn\u2019t seem to be harmed.\n\nThe rapper hit Instagram to respond to the surfaced footage. \u201cYo Tekashi, why they so mad at you? \u2018Cause your never gonna get touched.\u201d The rapper said on an Instagram video, \u201cWhy n*ggas want me to get touched so badly? It\u2019ll never happen. I told you n*ggas. They will never touch me.\u201d While that\u2019s just one incident, the rapper had another issue during his performance on Feb. 4th in Minnesota. While performing, someone threw a bucket of ice at the rapper and his entourage on stage. One of the members of the entourage took the bucket and threw it back.\n\nTekashi responded to this incident on Instagram this morning. \u201cStill untouched, man. Minnesota, we fuck with y\u2019all, man. Y\u2019all don\u2019t stop the bag man,\u201d he said on an IG video.\n\nCheck out the clips with the FULL story at www.itsKenBarbie.com "}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/799f32ebc1e5ffea2490354f2662c0a2/5B7EC6ED/t51.2885-15/e35/25009749_1512709962182960_703150235857190912_n.jpg", "tags": ["#kimzolciakbiermann", "#kimzolciak", "#briellebiermann", "#brielle", "#kenya", "#kenyamoore", "#rhoa", "#realhousewivesofatlanta", "#realhousewives", "#realhousewivesofatl", "#atl", "#atlanta", "#bravo", "#entertainment", "#entertainmentnews", "#media", "#gossip", "#gossipblog", "#rumors", "#girlfight", "#celebrities", "#celebrityblogger", "#kenbarbie", "#itskenbarbie"], "comments": 10, "likes": 399, "date": "2017-07-24T21:44:32.000Z", "description": "It\u2019s no secret that Kim Zolciak and Kenya Moore have been locked in a very public feud for months, but apparently temperatures flared to a new boiling point over the weekend.\n\nJust days after Zolciak announced her return to The Real Housewives Of Atlanta, she and Moore had an on-camera battle that was moments away from becoming an all-out girlfight, according to TMZ.\nThe fight between the ladies began almost instantly upon seeing each other, according to the reports, with Kim declaring that Kenya\u2019s new marriage to Marc Daly is fake. (Moore wed her new husband on June 10 in a secret ceremony that shocked fans of the series, who didn\u2019t even know she was dating somebody.) Kenya retorted to Kim\u2019s jab with a remark of her own, mentioning Zolciak\u2019s controversial tweet offering to pimp out her daughter Brielle for John Legend tickets.\n\nZolciak then claims to have heard Moore mention that the tickets were for her \u2018injured son\u2019 Kash, who was mauled by a dog around the time of the tweet.\n\nThis sent Kim into a frenzy, say sources, knocking over glasses to get closer to Kenya, having to be restrained by cast and crew members.\nSome of those who were on set claim to have not heard Moore\u2019s alleged remark about Kash.\nKim then left the scene of the fight, said to be genuinely upset over what transpired and not just trying to create drama \u2018for the show.\u2019 Over the weekend, Kim\u2019s 20-year-old daughter Brielle tweeted: \u2018kenya is a dumb ugly evil b****.\u2019\n.\nThe comment appeared to be unprovoked, but upon the new details of the weekend fight, make more sense.

Yikes. And there\u2019s more.\n\nSo, the obvious question is, who is the target of these bars? The easy answer that many members of social media went to was Nicki Minaj, as the two have been taking shots at each other for quite some time now. But, the heat could be aimed at Azealia Banks, who Remy recently beefed with on Instagram. Especially if you put the rhymes into context.\n\nThe two rappers traded shots a few weeks back, with Remy resorting to exposing old text messages she received from the Harlem MC, who at times sounded desperate to link up. After the dust settled, Banks contemplated suing Remy on social media.\n\nOr maybe, just maybe, Remy is only speaking in general? (Rappers do do that, you know?) What do you guys think?\n\nCheck out the preview of Remy Ma\u2019s new \u201cRoll in Peace (Remix)\u201d at www.itsKenBarbie.com and decide for yourself.
