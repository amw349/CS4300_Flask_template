So fun to shop the markets in each town and fill in the gaps of all my prop styling desires. One suggestion: Trust your gut, hold out on things that seem pricey and they will return to you later more unique and perhaps at a better price. Found silver in Paris and Avignon, french linen and baskets in Isle sur la Sorgue, lavender soaps and olive wood boards in Les Baux, linen dresses in Saint Remy, contemporary pottery in Arles and so much more. This antique shop was so beautifully presented in a garden setting filled with jasmine, honeysuckle and garden roses. The French do presentation so well while effortless. Continuing show & tell of my prop finds on snap chat. Currently on my way to Beaujolais/Bourgogne for wine tasting at a ch\u00e2teau, soaking up every bit of the Rh\u00f4ne Vally on our last day with @viking_cruises.

There are some new photos there too. This is all forcing a long overdue overhaul of the recipe section.

It's just perfect for Thanksgiving.\nFirst it's a single crust 'pie', therefore not too heavy after the most epic meal of the year with only 1 tbsp of sugar. Best of all it scores lots of pretty points with this frilly crust design but without a time consuming technique.\nThe recipe is on my website, link is above. Check out the full demo on my stories today. DM me if you have any questions and more importantly let me know if you plan to make it. I'll be making a few pear and apple versions myself, let's just say I'm grateful to have several Thanksgivings to drop in on. Hope you all have fun preparing for the best holiday \ud83e\udd83. Happy Thanksgiving.\n**full disclosure, this demo uses Granny Smith apples as a sub, and the skin was a little tough after baking.

I'd love to be in touch with someone who specializes in urban rooftop gardening. Anyone up for experimenting with some methods to collect rainwater (without a gutter, oye)? Setting up a heat shield (think sunglasses for a garden bed)? NYC roof top farming has a whole set of different issues in addition to regular gardening\u2026 evaporation, extreme heat exposure, plus I don't have a water source up there - so my job title continues to be 'Professional Schlepper'. Thank god for my partner & neighbor Stephanie.\n\ud83c\udf3f I clearly need help! If you know anyone, would you please let me know in the comments below or send me a dm/email? All advice welcome.

Typically I like to cut the butter in advance and freeze it overnight, but we didn't do that and it was just fine. Butter straight from the fridge. Good ingredients means good results. I use European cultured unsalted butter from @vermontcreamery. 86% butterfat, it makes a difference.\nThe recipe is on my website, link in profile. But if you want to make decorative pie, stick to my vodka pie crust, also on my site. Hope this encourages you to make some Peach or Heirloom Tomato pie while the produce is still around. I know I want to!

I feel lucky I got to see both friends & family to celebrate my favorite holiday! I love the little moments... drinking wine in a crammed kitchen while someone stirs the gravy, talking about the latest news in our lives while we chop onions. Bonus, thursday night included an epic game night of Celebrity. The kind where your face & belly hurt so much, but you never want it to stop. Priceless.\n\u2728I'm so grateful for the many things that makes my life full... loving friends and family, the community of artists that I admire and get to be a part of, the creative work (with less & less boundaries \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb) that I found as a second career and the countless friends who help make it happen, the failures that helped me self-correct to lead to some winning moments this year or just face harsh realities, the incredible clients that I love working with, and the people I meet that motivate me to share more of what I do and inspire me to be to more unique.\n\u2728Feeling washed all over with joy this past week. I'm so impressed by the bakers who have shared their creations during Thanksgiving that were inspired by a photo, video or recipe I posted on Instagram. They all looked so incredibly beautiful & tasty! All the tarts, pies, macarons even! Made me feel so proud. So, I realize I'm thankful for Instagram, a place that brings likeminded people together and builds a community of creatives. I was also blown away by all the people who came to our marketplace(s), all powered by @instagram btw!! Loved meeting you all \ud83d\udc95. Thank you for following along, taking time to comment (I swear, I always read them \ud83d\udc97) and sharing how we connect. Have a wonderful weekend.

I never anticipated that baking would be so rewarding and become such a creative form of expression in my life.

Spaghetti with Green Olives, Pancetta and Crispy Lemon Breadcrumbs. It\u2019s bright, briny, crunchy and creamy all at the same time.

It wasn\u2019t built properly to begin with but I was so excited to get it announced. Nevertheless, I\u2019m so excited for my first workshop. Oye, I had some ticketing snafu\u2019s, so tickets are still available. Come join me!\n\ud83c\udf1fThe Pie Workshop will include techniques to make decorative pies whether you have very little time or patience to a full afternoon and want a more detailed design. I\u2019ve been changing my philosophy on pie making, I\u2019ve been finding ways to make it easier and without all the fussy rules that are usually deemed critical. You guys seem into that too, I love how many Apple & Pear Tarts with a Ruffled Edge I\u2019ve seen since Thanksgiving! I break a lot of rules in my pie crusts lately but they turn out great, I can\u2019t wait to show them to you. Especially the new milk pie crust I made over the holidays, a new favorite and it does\u2019t require anything but your hands.\n\ud83c\udf1fThe workshop has only 3 students, so we\u2019ll get really into your baking questions and make multiple pies if there is time. Mini pies are a great way to test out new designs. I hope you\u2019ll take advantage of the cozy set up at my home studio where we get to focus on you, it might be a while before I get to teach this intimate class again based on my work schedule.\n\ud83c\udf3fAll the details are on my website, link above. Look at the itinerary section for the topics we'll discuss & take note of the one-on-one session for an Instagram portfolio review or frankly anything you\u2019d like to discuss. I'm so excited to bake with you. It will be delicious especially with sponsors like @vermontcreamery, more fun sponsors will be shared soon too, stay tuned. Happy Sunday! *Special thank you to @the.hawkes for all your help this week & getting things fixed up! Pie skills, YES. Technology, not so much! ***Second tech fail, sorry the profile link was broken & fixed now.

A shocking contrast to President Obama & @hillaryclinton that embrace minorities, the LGBTQ & female community. I feel numb. I feel heartbroken. I truly thought in this day & age we could elect a female president. We have so much work to do. We need to be an active participant in making change. We clearly need to repair our country. Truthfully I know I'm gonna be useless today, mourn our country. One that my parents worked so hard to immigrate to, one that gave my brothers and I the generous & privileged lives we live.

New visual references, flavor profiles & recipe development concepts, being away from reality so you can truly day dream. Along with the much needed rest.\n\u2728Thanks so much for the DM's I've received so far. Would love to continue to receive your favorite travel websites and blogs as well.\n\u2728This photo was taken on a holiday in Zanzibar, Africa at our most beloved @casadamarezanzibar.

I don\u2019t talk about this much, but I am self-taught in the world of styling & photography and think that\u2019s why I spend so much time working and obsess about learning. Every small thing I learn feels like a big win (usually stemming from a flop). Just takes time and patience. Currently trying to better balance work and time spent with friends, one of the infinite lessons to learn when working for yourself. (Work = time suck.) All you wonderful people I have seen so little of over the past few years while figuring out the freelance world, I miss you and definite have not forgotten you. (No idea what brought on this very long post, tks if you\u2019re still reading.)\nRecently I found I\u2019m really enjoying my work and feeling brave enough to stretch my comfort zone. Working with florals a lot and it nicely breaks up my food related work. Perhaps implied but don\u2019t think I ever said that I was writing a weekly recipe column for @delish *tks to @annawatsoncarl. Talk about a challenge. 15 months later & 325-ish recipes, I\u2019m a little zapped. Grateful for that AWESOME opportunity but also excited to have time for other projects\u2026 hopefully much more travel. Here\u2019s an idyllic scene from a French vineyard in Provence last Spring - I came back so refreshed and creative after that 3 week trip. I\u2019ll be sharing trips on a new travel portfolio like Provence, Kilimanjaro and Patagonia, but the moment there\u2019s just a sweet collection from Paris, so come back soon. Meanwhile I hope you\u2019ll take a peek at the new site and enjoy, link in profile. Happy Friday and cheers to all you badasses who are suicidal enough to be a freelancer! xoxo Jude \ud83e\udd42\n"}, {"img": "https://scontent-ort2-2.cdninstagram.com/vp/d42e15d9fe949beea24cdfe1f883dc47/5B5DD14A/t51.2885-15/e35/26155716_1613446505365491_5533971236687708160_n.jpg", "tags": ["#fbf", "#nyc"], "comments": 25, "likes": 1140, "date": "2017-02-10T14:41:50.000Z", "description": "This was the setting I made for my Mom's birthday years ago @kitchentablenyc.

A beautiful 1400 acre non-profit education center & working farm. Their ethos is incredible and I can't wait to learn more.\nWe witnessed their adorable children's program teaching kids where food comes from and the children's farmyard. A walk around the grounds brought us to this hilltop view with an array of the cheeses they produce on site & flowers from their gardens.\nAfter being hosted graciously by @vermontcreamery we were rewarded with a joint dinner that was vegetarian, based on what is grown at Shelburne Farms. Truly a special evening. Thank you!

Arrived at my brother\u2019s house in Boston with Layla just in time to see this beautiful sunset. It\u2019s been a hectic (sleepless) week of work and I\u2019m so happy I had this little fruit loop companion while I tried desperately to stay awake on the car ride (2 coffees and windows down for a rush of cold winter air barely did the trick). I\u2019ve been a little quieter than usual on Instagram lately, but wanted to let you know I love and read every single comment even if I\u2019m slow to respond. I\u2019m so thankful for this amazing community, even more thankful I\u2019ve had a chance to meet many of you from all over the world IRL. Right now I\u2019m sitting next to my brother, of course we\u2019re both staring at a computer or phone screen, but nonetheless I\u2019m hanging out with family and we\u2019re together. Reflecting on the year and I\u2019m so grateful for wonderful friends and family that I can never spend enough time with. There have been incredible and creative work opportunities that came this year. Damn. It still shocks me that I get to do what I do for work, lucky me! More importantly there have been countless people who have helped me improve all sides of my business and hopefully a few that I\u2019ve helped a long the way too. I\u2019m working on updating my apt to make it feel equal parts home and work studio. I want to make it function for all the needs of my crazy upside down life, but it\u2019s a life I wouldn\u2019t trade anything for. Hope you guys have a warm and delicious Thanksgiving! Ok, Ok enough sappiness, gotta make pie\u2026specifically experimenting with a new Pumpkin Pie + Cream Cheese Swirl. Lots of love to you.

It has a nice balance of tartness from the cranberries, subtle sweetness from the orange juice/zest and a bit of je ne sais quoi from aromatic bitters.\n\u2728It's also my first herringbone pattern. Looks more reg lattice than herringbone, but not terrible. I definitely had to concentrate a bit to keep track. But it\u2019s fun to experiment and figure out what I\u2019ll do differently to improve it\u2026 slightly wider strips (less to cut & keep track of \ud83d\ude09) and float the herringbone pattern over 2 strips instead of 3 to help make it more pronounced. I approach it like a little game.\n\u2728I have another Instagram Stories tutorial I'm putting together for this when the recipe is ready. Did you like the detailed tutorial from last week for the Apple Tart with Ruffled Edges? It was longer than usual, so I'm curious to know your feedback.

My sign came in the form of a grade 2 muscle tear in the calf a week ago. A few days of false hope led me to be on my feet a bit too long and it's now forcing me to literally lie down with my feet up.\nYesterday was supposed to be a day to break in my new @traegergrills BBQ \ud83d\ude22, but instead luckily I got a good old fashioned hang out with my girl @maddymadmads.\nI've been nonstop for months and almost not sure what my direction is. I now clearly see that slowing down and taking care of yourself is important. This injury is proving to be more painful than I could imagine but grateful that it's making me stop and think about things while I rest. I'd been feeling a bit overwhelmed and uninspired with work which has been keeping me from seeing friends because I felt unorganized and lacking in free time. I'm reviewing all my open projects and re-prioritizing, which feels \ud83d\ude33 but \u263a\ufe0f. Felt even less inspired about what I want to share and post here on Instagram. Lately it's felt less personal. Probably because I fell victim to the need to keep up \ud83d\ude44. It used to be much more spontaneous, not so much anymore. (Ok, I do blame the lame algorithm for taking some of the fun out of it). So I guess I'll change things up, even if it results in a lack of likes or engagement. We've all gotta do what we love creatively \ud83c\udfa8\ud83d\udcf7\ud83c\udf9e\ud83d\udc69\ud83c\udffb\u200d\ud83c\udf73.\nMeanwhile, quality time with Maddy included making a quick comforting Korean meal with a fast Skirt Steak Bulgogi, Cucumber Muchim (pickled with rice vinegar and sesame oil) with Kimchi and steamed rice. We made buttery @vermontcreamery @guittardchocolate chip cookies while watching the movie Spy (hilarious if you haven't seen it). I hadn't laughed that hard for a while. So, obviously not a typical Memorial Day weekend, but I am going to reward myself with a nap after this prolific post \ud83d\ude02.

I've been working hard on updating my home environment on the inside and out. Hoping that it will lead to more dinner parties and gatherings centered around food and drink.\nA highlight is the new marble dining table, which was generously passed to me by friends. It brings such lightness. Although I still adore my old farmhouse table, it now needs to move on. After much debate, I decided to refinish the surface and put it on the roof. I could've sold it for a few bucks, but I'm excited to give it a new life. I've gotten a bit handy these days, I bought a new sander and a bunch of other crazy equipment (Circular saw!), so let's see if I can do this right\ud83e\udd1e!\nI've been giving the roof garden more attention in terms of design this year, excited to see how it all unfolds. I have a new @traegergrills up there, so you know it's gonna be a delicious Summer! Stay tuned.
