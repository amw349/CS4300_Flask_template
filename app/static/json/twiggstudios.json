There are still spaces for the workshop in London I am doing with @silvia_salvialimone and @_twome in April, it\u2019s going to be a hands on workshop where we will all get a chance to dye fabric and use it to style and create a visual story, and we will teach all we know about food photography, styling and editing. We have planned it over two days so you can really get a chance to learn from us and practice with our guidance so you can go home and feel confident to shoot and style on your own.

Our guide told us that people often see a Feng Shui master each year who gives them tips on what colour cloths to wear for that year and what to do around the home. The Water element is represented by blue and black roof colors. According to Feng Shui A black house roof will create a constant flow of positive energy around a house. I find it so interesting. The best Feng Shui has water and mountains near by so that\u2019s why a lot of Chinese homes have ponds or water features and rock gardens.
