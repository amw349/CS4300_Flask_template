Now that the worst is over and I'm back home I finally am posting to share my story. Biotoxin poisoning is very serious and life threatening. When we're silent, we lose our power and that's never something I'm willing to do. I want to share exactly what happened and what we overcame because I want to do all I can to ensure that this never happens to anyone else. I pray that by sharing what I overcame in the face of the most insurmountable odds, it will hopefully inspire others to know that no matter what you face, it is truly possible to overcome anything if you refuse to give up. I have been posting small snippets of my journey back on insta story & snap but I will be sharing exactly what happened & showing what I've done & what I'm doing to reclaim my health. Health is everything and it effects every aspect of life. I lost some huge opportunities due to being sick from this biotin poisoning and a lot of relationships. But I am a fighter. I am a warrior. I never give up. Now I pray that by seeing my story you'll know that no matter what you may be dealing with, it is possible to persevere and overcome.

When you create your own success & work hard to achieve your dreams, you feel more confident. I graduated with a BA in Marketing and I had many academic honors including Dean's List and National Dean's List, and Who's Who in America's Colleges & Universities. I had both of my kids in college & raised them on my own while I was a full time student and I worked at American Express in financial advising and Coca Cola in Marketing. I graduated in 4 years and I overcame many obstacles without letting any of them stop me. I went back and got a second degree in Behavioral Science after we moved to California. I believe intelligence and strength is much sexier than most of the current fads which people are focusing on. It's time to applaud inner beauty, intelligence, and celebrate girls who achieve in sports and business. I was an athlete since I was very young. I began gymnastics & ballet when I was 2. I ran track and was a cheerleader since middle school. I became the youngest NFL Cheerleader in high school and I continued track into my first year of college.

You can't give someone time or attention who is not on your level. You can't allow pity or obligation so that a person won't get their feelings hurt when they're rejected cause you to give them attention or time that you otherwise wouldn't. A king and queen are a perfect match. A queen does not match with a jester. A jester will peacock and try to convince the court that they are more than a jester, but that is all they are. They will thrive off the little attention they were ever given and try to use it to manipulate they're next target to believe that they're better than they are because they were ever given attention by someone above their stature. They'll use the energy u gave them to seem better temporarily. When you're boss, u don't fraternize with the help. U align with someone who is mentally, spiritually, & emotionally on your level. You align with someone you can grow with, not someone you need to pull up to your level, because you will be pulling yourself down in that process. Once you find the perfect person, you don't waste your time trying to appease anyone's feelings or sugar coating. A real man makes men who try to convince others that they are better than they actually are look like immature little boys vying for attention. Real men are rare but once you find one, you appreciate them. You build with them. You love them. You nurture all of their amazing qualities and in the bond of reciprocal energy and union, an invincible strength is formed. You realize why any other person who came before them was simply showing you what wasn't good enough. You therefore appreciate them even more for who they are & how much greater you are for honoring your true self & refusing to settle. Any person can want to be in a relationship with you. The difference is knowing who deserves to be, because they are equally yoked with you. A man who puts God first & who has integrity, character, and true respect for women is a man who you can build a future with.

I waited & finished college in hopes that my family would take the plunge to move with us. I was tired of cross country commuting and ready to live in California.

Well, I couldn't run track pregnant, so I worked my ass off while having my kids, and graduated on the National Dean's List. I would take my babies to school and even breastfeed in class. But I never gave up. My kids were all that mattered so my college years were raising them, school and working. When we moved, we were starting over. No furniture. We had nothing material but we had everything that mattered - LOVE. I look back at that time with awe at how much was accomplished, and how much was overcome. Nothing comes remotely close to my children and my love for them. I don't post 99.99 percent of life, and the things that are important to me wouldn't get a lot of likes. Social media is social.

We overcame enormous difficulty & tragedy which included nearly dying from mold in our last home that rendered me incapacitated. I couldn't host my talk show, run my magazine or even see or walk. We ended up destitute and nobody came to our rescue. I was in court for several years and I won every case because many people in LA assume that others don't know their legal rights. I do know the laws and I refuse to be taken advantage of. I worked my butt off to provide for my kids and literally started from scratch with no health and no job or money. I rebuilt from square one and within a year I was able to turn things around. Losing several years of time is considered tragic in Hollywood, which is obsessed with youth. I'm now older and wiser. I now know the value of health, and I have an enormous passion to spend every possible moment with my kids. This may be boring to most but to me I would rather stay home every day than to be out doing things that don't matter with people who don't care. I share this in hope that it inspires anyone who may be going through a rough patch where things seem dismal and hopeless because it's true that anything is possible. You can overcome anything, no matter what the odds, just never give up. My journey is now just beginning because it's only been a couple months since the surgery to remove the blood clot and I am so excited for what the future holds.

When you find a rare woman whose internal beauty matches her external beauty, then you've virtually won the lottery. U cherish her bc you've found a jewel in a sea of made up imitations. It takes effort & persistence when you find the truth but it's worth the effort. A woman who has more internal beauty will not try hard to flaunt it nor will she be out in the scene. She doesn't need validation, she doesn't need anything externally. She knows her worth & the quality of treatment she deserves. She will expect to be pursued because she knows she's worth the effort. You only realize that by truly getting to know the real her which takes time. Only a king can value a true queen. A joker would keep trying to pursue other women even when he's found the rare opportunity to court a queen. He's led by his ego. He thinks conquest over many women makes him prove he's a bigger man. A real king finds a true queen & knows there is no further to look. He stops chasing other women because he knows this rare jewel is far greater than a conquest of 1000 empty \"bad bitches\" who only think of frivolous shallow materialistic things or about their external facade. They'll never better you as a man. When you find a queen & you make a true commitment to her, if you truly win her affection & create that powerful union, you then become like a God. Only the truly evolved, enlightened & wise will understand this. The rest will just keep chasing the pretty packages that have nothing inside. Yes everyone has learned to do makeup & get body & face upgrades. Cherish when you find a natural beauty whose internal beautiful soul outshines her beautiful exterior. Being humble & real is far better than constantly seeking validation through social media or otherwise. When you're real, you're living the moments, not staging them for posts just to get likes.

With conditioning from authority figures & others we slowly lost our magic. Our dreams faded & we learned to focus on $ & survival. The system programmed us to become workers; not thinkers or creators. We learned to memorize & recite & got rewarded for it. It's extremely apparent that anything we think or do almost instantaneously manifests. It's time to stop following what's supposedly popular like sheep just bc we're bombarded with it on tv & social media. There's a faction that wants to keep us asleep, distracted & programmed. Having us eat unhealthy foods that poison us & keeping us glued to our phones so we are constantly receiving radiation, programming & monitoring that comes from holding them & staring almost uncontrollably. Its time to wake up & have true change. It's time to be unique & stop caring what people may think or who may like you. What matters in this life is fulfilling your purpose & helping to change the world for the better. We are killing our planet at an alarming, unsustainable rate. It's time to focus on bettering ourselves, bettering our planet, & doing our part so we experience the true heaven on earth that we're here to thrive in! It starts with us. Our thoughts are truly things & as we choose to shift & make a ripple effect, the world will quickly be a better place. Yes it seems daunting to see those in power controlling the politics & the $ etc, but in truth, we massively outnumber those in power.

I was always considered a workaholic or a nerd and I'm proud of that because intelligence is beautiful. To me internal beauty of mind and spirit is what truly matters. We came from a small town in Ohio. I taught my kids everything I could & gave them the freedom to develop without limits and without judgments. My kids are my life. I don't have much of a social life and I choose for it to be that way. I would rather be my kids' driver & be there whenever they need me than be out at whatever trendy event. We live in a time where social media has so many people thinking they're missing out but when you know what truly matters, you realize it's the people so focused on impressing others who will never know the satisfaction of being happy internally. Never compare yourself to anyone else. Do what you love and focus on what you love. Your life is meant to be lived by you and not according to anyone else's lifestyle or standard.
