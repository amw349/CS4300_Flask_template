I made the decision to leave the Army in May 2006. At the time I had completed my second tour to Iraq, was now an instructor at the U.S. Army Medical Department Officer Basic Course, and had very few friends who had transitioned to the private sector. I was nervous, afraid, but excited for the possibilities. I had no idea what I would do or what to expect. A few weeks after making the decision, my father recommended business school. Not knowing a thing about the process, I simply applied, submitted a resume, took the GMAT, and held my breath for an acceptance letter. What I soon discovered was I was waitlisted or declined by all schools. One morning I received a message that Cornell's MBA program would be hosting a webinar for all waitlisted students. I attended and got an idea of what I should do to make my application more favorable. I decided to purchase a flight to Ithaca, NY, for the following week and schedule a meeting with the Dean of Admissions. I remember arriving to the Cornell campus in March 2006, to be welcomed by three feet of snow. I really had no idea what I was going to say, except, \"Can I attend your program?\" The following morning I put on a suit, drove to campus, and positioned myself in the waiting room of the admissions office. The Assistant Dean greeted me and took me to lunch at the Hospitality school hotel. She was very pleasant, we chatted, and she asked me a few questions. At the end of our meal she said, \"Congratulations, you have been accepted to be a member for the Cornell Johnson School of Business Class of 2009.\" This was just the beginning of professionals in the private sector taking a "}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/5756b1fffc0a687518e6e522198fe0a0/5B7F7508/t51.2885-15/e35/17126737_1692985400994570_7024692168233058304_n.jpg", "tags": [], "comments": 1, "likes": 175, "date": "2017-03-12T15:57:43.000Z", "description": "That sunset though \ud83c\udf04 We've experienced every season here in Ithaca this week but we're certainly looking forward to more sun and less snow \ud83d\udc4d\u2800\n\ud83d\udcf7: @peter.x.su"}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/be9baab58b0f8cb98d3dfd5a391bdbab/5B7A87F0/t51.2885-15/e15/11240386_104136996586769_337976003_n.jpg", "tags": ["#SlopeDay", "#CornellMBA", "#nerds"], "comments": 1, "likes": 38, "date": "2015-05-07T21:13:28.000Z", "description": ""}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/59585b672e4e92c03f5bf6a9800f2663/5B9CD76C/t51.2885-15/e35/21980837_1747774212193039_6417022568649195520_n.jpg", "tags": ["#CornellMBA", "#PowerPerformance17", "#nbmbaa", "#Cornell", "#MBA", "#Prospanica", "#Leadership", "#Diversity"], "comments": 0, "likes": 149, "date": "2017-09-29T00:15:35.000Z", "description": ""}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/760bee413f8b1c712e6a35510f821c7f/5B96F959/t51.2885-15/e35/20393842_1916375618624258_7856497857384153088_n.jpg", "tags": ["#EMBA", "#NY"], "comments": 0, "likes": 130, "date": "2017-07-28T18:46:09.000Z", "description": "Our "}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/31a799b917a09fafca761781f0c4550d/5B9471D9/t51.2885-15/e35/23279209_572700776397084_8638807840904970240_n.jpg", "tags": [], "comments": 0, "likes": 47, "date": "2017-11-07T02:01:22.000Z", "description": "One goal for Product Studio is for Johnson Cornell Tech MBA students to develop sufficient understanding about today\u2019s emerging technologies.
