I always ask them, who told you that? Would you believe I've tracked it down to Oprah Winfrey herself? In the late 80s when Oprah Winfrey lost weight, one of the times she lost weight, she told people she stopped eating after 4 PM. Some people took this at face value, and thought the key to weight loss is not eating past 4 PM, when in fact all she was doing was eating less calories over the course of the day. If you eat 3000 cal before 4 PM, versus eating 3000 cal spread evenly over the course of the day, you might even be worse off with the 4 PM fasting version. Bottom line, it's what you eat, and how much you eat. These are the most important factors.

Hot Pilates. Heated dance cardio. Warm Spin studios. Everywhere you turn, there's a boutique studio fitness class turning up the temperature and leaving you a sweaty, disgusting mess by the end of your workout. But it's not actually helping you reach your weight-loss goals (if weight loss is your goal, that is). \"Exercising in a cool environment actually contributes to greater caloric expenditure than exercising in a warm environment,\" celebrity trainer Harley Pasternak, MSc, told POPSUGAR. The New York Times bestselling author was debunking fitness myths left and right at the Fitbit summit in New York last week, and he gave us some details on why a cold workout is more optimal. \"There's no need to be in a hot room and having your shirt dripping in sweat in order to burn fat,\" he said. \"You burn way more fat in a cold room than in a hot room, [because] exercising in a cooler environment is more conducive to caloric expenditure and fat metabolism.\nHis claims are rooted in and backed by science; a 1997 study showed how cooler temperatures can combat obesity, and a 2014 study showed that \"cold exposure increases energy expenditure.\" We also know that cold temperatures promote the increase of brown fat in the body \u2014 the \"good kind\" of fat to have \u2014 which can increase your metabolism.\n\nOne of the best ways you can try this is by getting outside. \"Now that we're heading into Fall or Winter, don't be afraid to go outside and go for a great walk; there's no better time to do it,\" Harley said. \"We're approaching the season where there's nothing better [for your health] than a brisk evening walk.\" Or you can follow Harley's own method and walk early in the morning (when it's cool) to go get your coffee \u2014 and your 10,000 steps.\nSo does this mean we have to skip hot yoga? \"Don't skip Bikram yoga if you really enjoy and it makes you really happy,\" he said, \"but don't look at it as a place where you're going to be burning calories. The hot temperature is about keeping your muscles loose and pliable, not to burn more calories\".

He expanded on his thoughts of the diet and lifestyle, saying \"it's antisocial, [and] it makes you have terrible breath.\" Harley also warned against the concept of fasting with the keto diet. \"You're cannibalizing and metabolizing your lean tissue, your healthy tissue in your body,\" he said. \"Life is too short; embrace it,\" he said.

An ambulance driving by in the middle of the night or an air conditioning unit on the roof turning on can actually wake you up if you\u2019re not wearing your plugs. And forth, I sleep with a sound machine. I got the idea after watching how well my kids slept with sound machines.

Seafoods has had a tough time in the media lately with a lot of hokey documentaries trying to convince people that eating fish will kill them. This couldn't be further from the truth. Seafood is one of the best forms of protein and healthiest forms of fat you could possibly put in your body. The key to finding quality seafood is obeying the following three criteria. First, buy wild. Whenever possible wild seafood is a better way to go than farmed seafood. Next, buy domestic. If you happen to be lucky enough to live near water and have a local fisherman bring you their daily catch, fantastic. At the very least, try and stick to seafood that's been caught within your country. 90% of the seafood consumed in the United States is imported from countries with very lax guidelines for fishing. Third, stick to small seafood. The bigger the Fish the more mercury, the smaller the fish, less mercury. Think of scallops, shrimp, sardines, squid, and any and all freshwater fish you can think of.

Most of us fall into healthy daily routines when we're at home. From our standard breakfasts, our daily exercise routines, and sleeping with our favorite pillows.

I bring with a little psyllium fiber wherever I go (airport security thinks I'm smuggling some weird new drug), but sometimes that's still not enough. It's important we also get some good probiotics into our daily diet. This ranges from yogurts, kefir, kimchi, sauerkraut, and any other food you can think of that has fermented.

In the past, flu vaccines are 40 to 60% effective. The medical community still suggests that you do get a flu shot to reduce your chance against other strains of the flu as well. If you're feeling feverish, aches and pains, nausea, just shut it down. Rest, fluids, check your temperature, and listen to your body. It's really important you have someone keep an eye on you. If you feel like you might have the flu, call a friend or family member or coworker and let them know what you're going through. Wearing a mask won't necessarily stop you from getting the flu, but it will certainly reduce your chances of you spreading the flu to someone else.

Apple cider vinegar has been associated with nonsupported claims for weight loss, digestive health, skin health, and dozens of other health benefits. The truth is, there is very little evidence to support any of these claims. There is evidence, however, showing that chronic use of apple cider vinegar can lead to tooth decay and digestive issues. On a positive note, there have been a couple of studies that showed some promise with the use of small amounts of vinegar a day on insulin, blood sugar, and possibly weight loss. It's important to note that the benefits associated with vinegar use, or more about all vinegars, and not specific to apple cider vinegar. Chinese medicine has long espoused the use of small amounts of rice wine vinegar, Japanese chefs have been using vinegar as a key component to healthy meals for hundreds of years, and Mediterranean diets have always included aged balsamic vinegar to create healthy cooking. So, if you want to experiment with adding small amounts of vinegar in your diet, try adding some balsamic vinegar on your salad, or rice wine vinegar and dressings. It does not have to exclusively be through the use of apple cider vinegar.

This will be my new mantra in 2018. In Japan, you really understand how much the healthiest country in the world values quality over quantity. The greatest example of this is the fruits and vegetables in their grocery stores. Until you've had a Japanese strawberry, you've never actually tasted a strawberry. The colour, texture, smell, and taste leave you speechless. In fact, so much thought and care goes into growing each individual strawberry, they are often sold individually, wrapped, swaddled, and boxed. While they can be very expensive, it's worth it. I think If we were to approach all aspects of our life with the same thought and care as the Japanese show with one single strawberry, we would all live happier healthier lives. Next time you prepare a meal, take your time to ensure it has everything you need, looks delicious, tastes delicious, and feels delicious. Next time you exercise, focus on each individual set and each individual repetition. Feel your muscles, breathe, be present.

So five workouts a week each with five 5-minute phases. I remember when my literary agent, Andy Barzvi, called to tell me \u201conly Harry Potter was higher on the bestseller list\u201d. It was surreal! Well, 15 years and six books later, it\u2019s still surreal! Thank you to everyone who supported and ever bought any of my books, thank you to the incredible clients I\u2019ve had over the years who put their trust in me, thank you to Halle berry for your kindness, and thank you to Andy Barzvi for getting me published and keeping me published.

Like most people, I don't love pull-ups. Whether you be a big guy like me, or petite lady like some of our clients, doing proper pull ups with your own bodyweight for several reps and sets is incredibly difficult. I like this piece of equipment because it works on an angled ramp that allows you to mimic the pull-up motion with a percentage of your bodyweight. Unlike the traditional chin/ dip selectorized assisted pieces of equipment you see in the gym, this piece is far smaller, lighter, and feels exponentially better.

All too often we get taken advantage of by food manufacturers who trick us into thinking were eating less calories, sugar, or fat than we really are. It's up to you to critically examine these labels and decide for yourself. The simplest way to do so is multiply the carbohydrates by four then multiply the proteins by four then multiply the fat by nine. Add this number altogether, and this will give you the total calories per serving. You'll be shocked when you start doing this to the jars and containers and bottles in your fridge. At least half of them are off. The second thing to be aware of is how many servings in that package. Coconut water is one of the most guilty of products that I'm aware of, when they list only 40 cal per serving, then in small print it says 3.5 servings per bottle.

Moreover, many of these taste a lot better and are easier to digest then kale. Covering kale with oil and baking to make chips, has become way to accepted, and is actually not far off from eating potato chips and french fries. So, if you love kale, keep eating kale. But if you're like me, and you don't really love kale, there are countless alternatives that are even healthier for you to consider.

This \"cure-all\", \"super food\" from the Amazon, got a lot of notoriety in the last 10 years when one small study showed that It was high in antioxidants. Well guess what, so are BlackBerries, blueberries, dark chocolate, artichokes, and dozens of other foods that are incredibly easy to get, taste great, and won't break the bank. But what concerns me the most, is 99% of the time, A\u00e7ai berries are actually just the skin of the fruit, blended up with a bunch of sugar, heavily processed, frozen in small packages, and shipped to us in North America, Europe, and Asia. The truth is, A\u00e7ai paste, and yes it really is just a paste, tastes very very bad. So the manufacturers add a ton of sugar in the processing of the fruit before they package it. Then, to make matters worse, people go to restaurants and order an a\u00e7ai bowl, that's loaded with tons of more sugar in the form of granola, and tropical fruits to make this purple paste taste delicious. People don't realize these quasi-healthy a\u00e7ai bowls, are giant sugar bombs. That being said, I say is definitely not bad for you, and still has some nutritional benefits. So if you're looking for a low guilt dessert, have a small a\u00e7ai bowl. If you're looking to replace a balanced meal with an a\u00e7ai bowl,think again.

A recent meta-analysis, a collection of hundreds of studies in the past, demonstrated that there is no link between salt consumption and poor health. Research was unable to establish a link between eating more salt and getting more heart disease or strokes. In fact, recent research actually demonstrated a decrease in blood pressure, and some actual Weight loss with the addition of small amounts of salt to your existing diet. The caveat to this is if you have kidney problems or other health issues that your doctor has warned you about, but if you're a healthy person, do not fear salt.

The answer is, you do not need to be sore to have had an effective workout. Many people used to attribute muscle soreness to a buildup of lactic acid after an intense workout. We now know that this is not the case. Muscle soreness tends to peak around 48 hours after a workout, and is a result of creating small tears in your muscle fibers. This trauma can actually be a good thing, and Ideally will recover as a stronger/ fitter muscle. However, you do not need to be sore to accomplish this. Moreover, excessive muscle soreness can be a bad thing, and actually hinder your ability to do future workouts effectively. Bottom line, while you don't need to be sore to have had a good workout, a little soreness is OK, a lot is not.

Not really! The glycemic index is a measure of the impact of certain ingredients on our blood sugar. We have been told for a long time that foods like white rice and potatoes will make us fat because they have a high glycemic index. The reality is we very rarely eat ingredients on their own. The combination of protein, or fiber, or fat to a meal will lower the glycemic index. When was the last time you ate a bowl of white rice by itself as a meal? Most likely, you would have a stirfry on top with vegetables and chicken. Moreover, a recent study published examining the dietary practices of women eating either a high glycemic or low glycemic index diet over 18 months, found no difference in weight loss. Your focus should be on making sure you have the holy Trinity of satiety and metabolism with each meal\u2026\u2026 Protein, fiber, and healthy fats....and don't let white rice scare you!!

Even if weight loss is your goal, you might find that you love the peace and calm that comes from yoga, the mood boost that comes from Zumba, or the strength that comes from a boot-camp class.\nThat said, if you're prioritizing weight loss, you might want to reprioritize (and reassess your routine!). Celeb trainer and New York Times bestselling author Harley Pasternak, MSc, recently told us that one health trend he's annoyed by is \"doing yoga or Pilates as a way to lose weight.\" He told POPSUGAR, \"Those [workouts] have merits, those have value \u2014 strengthening, toning, balance, flexibility \u2014 but neither one of those are an effective way to lose weight.\" \"You still need to move, you still need to walk,\" he said, emphasizing that walking at least once a day is the best way to lose weight. \"You get lean in life, strong in the gym.\" So don't ditch yoga or Pilates by any means, but know that fat burning and weight loss will come from other types of movement - even those that simple as just going for a walk!

They make me gain weight.\" or \"If I even think about chocolate cake, I gain 10 pounds.\" etc. etc.\n-\nWhen most of us think about carby foods, we tend to think of all our favorites like: \ud83c\udf70 cake\n\ud83e\udd50 croissant\n\ud83c\udf5f fries\n\ud83c\udf55 pizza\n\ud83c\udf69 donuts\n-\nBut when you look at the fat content of these foods -- it can make up as much as half the calories (or more). Just look above in my example. Most donuts are fried and that's what makes them so tasty. Half of the calories are fat from the oil and batter.\n-\nAnd then other foods like potatoes\ud83e\udd54, sweet potatoes\ud83c\udf60, rice \ud83c\udf5a, veggies \ud83e\udd55\ud83e\udd52\ud83e\udd57, and fruits \ud83c\udf52\ud83c\udf4a\ud83c\udf4d are mostly all carbohydrates. But these foods on their own rarely taste good without at least a little fat. A baked potato is always better with a pat of butter or sour cream. A salad isn't too tasty unless it has some dressing (that usually contains fat). -\n\u27a1\ufe0f SO WHAT'S THE DEAL?\n-\nAt the end of the day, when people say \"carbs make me fat\" a better statement would be \"carbs and fat mixed together in foods that are super easy to overeat on make me fat.\"\n-\nAny excess of food, be it fat, carbs or protein will cause weight gain. Calories matter. But it's way easier to over eat on the donuts, cake, fries and buttery bread than it is on large amount of rice, veggies, or sweet potatoes.\n-\n300g of sweet potatoes with a pat of butter and a dash of cinnamon would still be fewer calories and less fat than a large donut that you could easily eat 2 or 3 of in one sitting.\n-\n", "tags": ["#weightloss", "#weightlosstips", "#weightlossfood", "#therationaltrainer"]}, {"date": "2017-04-02T16:55:14.000Z", "likes": 411, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/c98a2759e5a3587bfa213819ff372c3e/5B5DFCFC/t51.2885-15/e35/17438898_1832940366971299_6844432017157783552_n.jpg", "comments": 11, "description": "Blend baby!

Due to concern that gluten may also increase the risk of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease among healthy people, the number of people without celiac disease who have adopted a gluten-free diet grew more than threefold from 2009 to 2014.\n\nA team led by researchers from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health used 20 to 30 years of data from the 64,714 women in the Nurses' Health Study and the 45,305 men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study to examine the relationship of dietary gluten to the risk of chronic conditions such as coronary artery disease in people without celiac disease or heart disease. All the participants had completed questionnaires on their diet and health every four years from 1986 through 2010.\n\nThe team found no significant association between the participants' estimated gluten intake and their risk of developing coronary artery disease. Moreover, further analyses suggested that restricting dietary gluten may reduce a person's intake any of whole grains, which are associated with lower cardiovascular risk.\n\nThe authors point out that this is an observational study, so no firm conclusions can be drawn about cause and effect. Nevertheless, they conclude that their findings do not support the promotion of a gluten-restricted diet to reduce coronary artery disease risk.

While he previously told us his top three tips to shed the pounds, at a Reebok event he emphasized that losing weight is a journey. \"I tell everyone to focus on the process rather than the end goal,\" he said.\n\nKnowing this might sound strange to someone trying to knock off those 10 to 15 pounds in a hurry, Harley said: \"If someone comes to me and says I want to lose 20 pounds, I'll say let's change that goal because you don't have direct control over that. You have indirect ones and if you dedicate yourself to the process and make that your goal, as a byproduct you'll hit your goal. So for example, I'll say your goal is to hit 12,000 steps a day. Your goal is to eat protein and fiber five times a day. Your goal is to get seven hours of sleep a night.\"\nTo sum up Harley's words of wisdom: there are no shortcuts to weight loss. It's in your best interest to start small, whether that's by changing your diet or switching up your fitness routine, because this all leads to a more positive outlook and result. And if you need help tracking your steps (something Harley loves), he recommends a Fitbit or downloading the Fitbit app. \"Everybody has a way to measure your activity these days,\" he said.", "tags": []}, {"date": "2017-01-13T20:27:26.000Z", "likes": 4862, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/bf8760413a518c6fdffbfb0253e03cec/5ADBA811/t51.2885-15/e15/15876310_680471328798157_1550515294441570304_n.jpg", "comments": 6, "description": "Step-ups with a view ", "tags": ["#revengebody"]}, {"date": "2017-12-20T18:58:54.000Z", "likes": 5212, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/ea1bd80702883a810976dabb858e1690/5ADB5D38/t51.2885-15/e15/25014894_2005629072992491_1307633132916178944_n.jpg", "comments": 25, "description": "60 seconds on .....", "tags": ["#60seconds", "#60seconds"]}, {"date": "2016-12-11T07:22:23.000Z", "likes": 2766, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/a7264376c83fb98437319ca396dc0e16/5ADB43DF/t51.2885-15/e15/15276573_232991153790735_1135942983489683456_n.jpg", "comments": 9, "description": "NFL legend @nateburleson dropped down and gave me 20 push ups last night at dinner ( I just kept eating )", "tags": []}, {"date": "2017-10-12T15:36:37.000Z", "likes": 3778, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/d702f7bf6f8c7e066a62383f1b44128a/5ADB2ECD/t51.2885-15/e15/22426679_1438762539575374_8382368056764006400_n.jpg", "comments": 25, "description": "Is counting calories the best way to lose weight?

Rylie, you're amazing and I am very very proud. (@get_repost)\n\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\nI\u2019ve thought long and hard whether or not to post this, but I figured it could inspire someone somewhere. After having Solo I was the heaviest I\u2019ve ever been. I was discouraged and felt like I\u2019d never get in shape again. After my nephew passed away, I figured it was time to get myself into shape. I started out slowly with just walking and The Body Reset Diet. I had many set backs, but I kept jumping back on track. I\u2019m not to my goal yet, but I\u2019m closer. If I can do it with 4 crazy kids, anyone can.

Especially when it comes to creating good eating habits for our kids. In my experience, forbidding anything from your child's diet totally, can create some bad habits in the future.

The video attached shows my daughter at a birthday party yesterday choosing between juice and cake. Yes, that's right, I said juice and cake. We teach our children that juice is a sweet indulgence to be had once in a while as a treat, not as a way of staying hydrated throughout the day. In fact, a large glass of apple juice or orange juice, may actually have far more sugar than any slice of birthday cake.

The answer is NO!\nSome people prefer to eat a diet where they do not cook their food. Not only does it significantly limit the amount of foods that you can eat, it poses a challenge when it comes to digestion and the bioavailability of many nutrients. Moreover, well over 48 million Americans per year get food poisoning, and you're really asking for it by not cooking your food at all. While there is some truth that over cooking your food is not a great idea, not cooking your food at all is not really the solution. Foods like tomatoes, carrots, zucchini, squash, and many others, are much healthier when you cook them. Bottom line, gently cook your foods, just don't over cook them.
