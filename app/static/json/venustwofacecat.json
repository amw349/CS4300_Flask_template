He is critical!!\nLeg was ripped off by being accidentally run over at a golf course so we trapped him and @goodkarmapetrescue is taking he and his brother (trapped them both at the same time) into the rescue and all of the expenses to go with it.\nIt wasn't as urgent til now because he had surgery Wed to amputate the remaining nub and was sent home last night. Now he has a high temp and the bone is infected to the point an abscess formed and filled with infection causing his stitches to start coming loose!\nHe will most likely need to have emergency surgery by a specialist tonight and that alone will come with a few thousand $$$ vet bill to @goodkarmapetrescue . They have had so many cases like this they've bravely taken on and have taken a turn for the worse that they are in major debt.\nPlease go to the link in the bio to donate whatever you can. Even small amounts help. This kitten needs our help to pull through and Good Karma needs our help with the bill that's coming.\nI am posting this fast because we will probably be taking him to a different emergency center tonight that has an ortho specialist to save his life!\nPlease help with what you can and send purrrayers and good vibes for this poor boy.\nYou can put in the comments that your donation is for Trey.\nI will give updates as soon as I can!! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\nThanks everyone! \ud83d\ude3d", "likes": 29646, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/84a778fe13f316e9d421eae03c87a06e/5B771725/t51.2885-15/e35/13423571_1571361943163836_385558282_n.jpg"}, {"tags": [], "date": "2015-10-03T17:23:00.000Z", "comments": 25, "description": "Happy Caturday! \ud83d\ude3a\ud83d\ude3a", "likes": 22894, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/cee7a33a43c766f96fe0251102fcf993/5B95DE7E/t51.2885-15/e35/11881710_544548909030385_734034777_n.jpg"}, {"tags": ["#camerashy"], "date": "2014-09-04T03:14:34.000Z", "comments": 25, "description": "No not now, my fur is a mess! \ud83d\ude40\n", "likes": 11761, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/ccf1a0b0a026f4ae5a082f7d9b058c79/5B60A9EC/t51.2885-15/e15/10632284_826492780718188_247064125_n.jpg"}, {"tags": ["#missyoumojo", "#wishyouwerehere"], "date": "2014-12-25T17:21:09.000Z", "comments": 25, "description": "Santa brought me a special ornament this year.

I am not offended Btw, actually this really intrigued me. So I looked at a whole bunch of pics of her, people, my other pets, etc, and discovered that in the majority of pics, if you zoom in on the eyes, one eye is crystal clear and the other not as much.

It wouldn't have changed anything in Mojo's case by the time he displayed symptoms but catching Venus acting strange and getting her emergency treatment saved her life. She too went from seeming fine in the morning to suddenly limp & lethargic laying in one of the litter boxes. She overcame a UTI & complete urinary blockage (which took a while to completely heal from & rarely happens in females) which is one of the illnesses mentioned and Mojo as you know crossed the rainbow bridge due to one of the other conditions mentioned which is HCM (cardiomyopathy). Please take a moment & become familiar with the symptoms of these silent killers. The more aware you are, the better chance your pet will have of not having to face critical condition or death.\nHere is the link to the site.\nhttps://www.petfinder.com/cats/cat-health/serious-cat-illnesses-vet-diagnose/\nI know those on Instagram can't click it so I'll be putting it in the bio section.

He'll be reunited with his brother Trenton and soon, @goodkarmapetrescue will be accepting adoption apps for them. I'll post specific adoption info as I get it.

Open discussion. I want to especially hear from veterinarians and vet techs.\nMama was told at a visit in December that I should get a cleaning which requires being put under anesthesia which has risks of its own. That makes her very nervous. After this pic was taken we went for another vet visit and one of the techs just scraped off the tarter/plaque visible in this pic with her nail.\nAll pet parents are nervous about their fur baby having to be put under so my question is.... I'm 8 years old, my chompers look and work well (just ask my little human's toys he leave around and I hunt as trophies for mama...nerf darts are a favorite) so how necessary is it to have this tooth cleaning procedure? Is it possible to do it with less risk than being put under just like a surgical procedure? Halo had hers done when her first eye had to come out from Glaucoma otherwise she would've had the same question for her. Are there safer ways to protect against decay or what could turn into a bad tooth or worse? Or it up there on the importance list to where the benefits of having the cleaning far outweigh the risks of general anesthesia? What do stray cats do who live outdoors for 20 years? Mama had a neighbor in FL who has 5 indoor/outdoor kitties that she took in in 1995 as kittens/strays and they're all alive and well with never having to go to a vet. She feeds cheap store bought food, use cheap litter (or outdoors), and they're 22 years old.\nAnyway, what are your thoughts and experiences on feline tooth cleaning and the risks associated?\nThanks in advance for your input! \ud83d\ude3d\ud83d\ude3d", "likes": 33173, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/e4f87663bb3af1d8d218dda078a037e6/5B688C88/t51.2885-15/e35/21910904_132756207367145_462929815888986112_n.jpg"}, {"tags": ["#flashbackfriday"], "date": "2014-05-02T12:17:14.000Z", "comments": 25, "description": "", "likes": 8646, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/1367894cfe2c6a7187c63e1e7187fcc6/5B98241F/t51.2885-15/e15/10326481_462656080533063_1090346624_n.jpg"}, {"tags": ["#halloween", "#trickortreat", "#boo"], "date": "2017-10-31T15:39:22.000Z", "comments": 25, "description": "\ud83c\udf83\ud83d\udc7b Happy Halloween! \ud83d\udc7b\ud83c\udf83\n", "likes": 22090, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/b680ccf665d94ed114e5135e5e00dd0c/5B7CD61F/t51.2885-15/e35/23098852_490120784680220_519767488938901504_n.jpg"}, {"tags": ["#7", "#catshelpingcats", "#meetandgreet", "#adoptdontshop", "#spayandneuter", "#7yearsyoung"], "date": "2016-07-19T16:53:46.000Z", "comments": 25, "description": "Guess what!

He doesn't put weight on his right front leg (so he's a tripod) when he walks but he can use it to play and pull his claws on a scratch post.\nA little background on Roo:\nHe was not bred this way. He was rescued by someone who witnessed someone else throwing him away like trash into a lake in a plastic bag likely because he was not normal like the rest of the litter. Luckily this other person saw this happen & brought him to @florida_humane_society where they adopted him out as a kitten.\nThree years later he was returned by those adopters in very bad shape, emaciated. He was missing patches of fur and we recently noticed (if you compare to the pic posted Thursday) that his \"pouch\" has fur on it now. When we got him we didn't think there ever was fur there.\nHe sat at Florida Humane Society for 6 months until we went there met him, and fell in love with all of the reasons that one person literally threw him away (probably the deformed kitten of a litter) and another neglected him and ultimately returned him like a bad product. Where they saw deformities and some neurological challenges we saw uniqueness, a sweet personality that was dying to be loved, and a cat that deserved a chance. He was very skittish when we first got him (almost a year ago) but he looks so much different and has gone from a scared boy that would hide all day and jump & scatter every time you walked by him to a very affectionate trusting and friendly boy who jumps at every chance to occupy lap space. He is so content and happy and his purrs are a daily reminder of how one man's trash can be another's treasure.\nHe has radial hypoplasia which is why his front legs are bent, abnormally large rear legs to compensate so he can stand up steady, crossed eyes, big ears, a big crooked tail that was most likely broken after birth, and we LOVE all of those things about him!\nWe fell in love with all the reasons someone else thought he was trash and he didn't deserve to live.\n", "likes": 22470, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/6569cca1d5c1c194b694e120693ee65e/5AE3573C/t51.2885-15/e15/12224466_1093464113999084_110457377_n.jpg"}, {"tags": [], "date": "2013-10-08T12:48:04.000Z", "comments": 25, "description": "Most comfy place in the house! \ud83d\ude3d", "likes": 3182, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/e464eb475246b8b5b0734c83bbb96963/5B61D4F1/t51.2885-15/e15/11355198_103527553319753_1311809340_n.jpg"}, {"tags": ["#adoptdontshop", "#spayandneuter", "#rescue", "#petsgiving", "#Repost", "#Petsgiving", "#Petsgiving", "#Petsgiving"], "date": "2015-11-23T18:27:25.000Z", "comments": 25, "description": "We are thankful for companies like @petsmart & @petsmartcharities that work with rescues, are adoption friendly, and do so much for animals in need!

Taking it back to about 2 years ago when we were asked to help a few day old kitten who had been thrown out of a car window. We got him with his eyes closed, burnt paw pads, and a little scrawny lacerated tail. Buddy lost his tail as a result but thrived each week and ended up a handsome, strapping 22 lb tall and muscular \"bobtail\" cat. He has a wonderful home now not far from where he was rescued from the street and is all grown up. He lives with 2 little girls who dress him up, tuck him in a baby doll bed, and push him around in a pink stroller.

We've had it for months and Mojo got in it right away. Mama tried to get pics of me in it but I wouldn't go near it.\nThe picture of me in it was taken the day that Mojo went to the pet ER & later passed away. Mama wonders if I got in it to try to tell her something was wrong or if I was sad because I knew my best buddy was dying before anyone else. I've been in it at least once per day since Mojo passed and mama thinks it's because I miss Mojo and lay in it to feel close to him & can smell him.\nAnyway, it's really comfy and I wanted to let you know where you can get one for your pet if you want.

Kitties who sneak out or run away.... but worse, when they don't have a microchip, collar, and are not spayed/neutered. Mama stopped today to pick up a kitty who had been hit by a car in front of a school campus w/ an elementary, middle, and high school. He was already deceased and had likely been hit last night. She's done this before for a few reasons. It's hurtful/sad for kids to see animals lying roadside (esp in front of a school) and she takes them to a nearby vet who will scan for a microchip in hopes she can bring someone closure if the kitty has a human. If no human comes forward (yes she searches everywhere for missing cat notices) the kitty will at least be cremated and not just left on the road to disintegrate.\nThis kitty had no collar, wasn't neutered, and didn't have a microchip. He was likely a stray but there are so many stories of lost and found pets with no identification and mama wants to drive in the importance of wearing a safety breakaway collar with an ID tag and microchipping your pet so you can be reunited. Equally, if not more important is spaying and neutering. This poor kitty was probably part of a stray colony, a colony that will grow larger and larger if our humans don't help. There are TNR (trap, neuter, return) programs just about everywhere. Please consider volunteering some time to this very important cause to keep more and more strays from being born homeless.\nThe recent hurricanes bring to light another reason why microchipping is so helpful even if your pet never goes outside. We never know how natural disasters or other unforeseen events may affect us where we furbabies might wander away from home. We want to be reunited with our humans so please make sure we have a way to get back to you if we get lost.\nOur thoughts and purrayers are with those affected by the recent storms and other tragic events happening in various places. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude3d\nThanks for listening!

Back in September she had to have her right eye removed and the biopsy revealed it was primary glaucoma meaning it's hereditary & that inevitably we'd be right here dealing with the other eye. \ud83d\ude3f\nShe's going to be sedated and the eye fully examined to determine the best course of action for this eye. From what we can tell (which has progressed so quickly in a matter of days just like last time), the vision is now gone during the day too (it was just a night a couple weeks ago) and she'll likely have to have this eye removed as well. She wasn't in pain until today and last week I proactively made an appt with the eye specialist because I knew we were getting close & needed to create a plan of action for when things got bad (which is when vision is totally lost). The appt was for 4:30 today. We didn't make it because of her waking up panting with pain and no vision at all. We brought her to emergency so she didn't have to suffer all day. This is how fast this awful disease progresses. Unlike people, pets can go from doing ok and managing with pressure drops to ending up at emergency within a weekend!\nPlease read up on glaucoma and become familiar with the signs/symptoms. Many mistake a wet eye for seasonal allergies and it could be glaucoma. Cats can get glaucoma too so this isn't just for dog owners. Better to check and be safe than sorry.\nSo now we wait.... we will update as soon as we know more.\nXOXO\nUPDATE: pressures were in the 80's & there is no vision so enucleation (eye removal) will be performed just like 9 months ago. Unfortunately that's just the way glaucoma ends most times. She will be pain free and back home tonight. This ordeal will finally be over and she can start acclimating to getting around without vision. Thank you all for all the love and well wishes! \ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude3d", "likes": 24245, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/c928b515f38a70a5dc3b13bc61663886/5B629846/t51.2885-15/e35/19122357_811783452303436_2725813870718353408_n.jpg"}, {"tags": ["#roo", "#venus", "#halo", "#shibainu", "#dogthinkssheisacat"], "date": "2015-03-09T16:38:01.000Z", "comments": 25, "description": "Halo \"How come I can't play on the @mykittykan scratch mountain?\" Go to @mykittykan or www.mykittykan.com to check out all of the fun eco friendly products they have.\n", "likes": 13406, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/cfe8d10245eeea58823e26ec200a65dc/5B6491EB/t51.2885-15/e15/11032961_1544474865820238_2075404776_n.jpg"}, {"tags": ["#snuggling", "#kitty", "#goodnight"], "date": "2014-06-21T02:10:56.000Z", "comments": 25, "description": "Little person on sofa in sleeping bag = warm, comfy lap! \ud83d\udca4\n", "likes": 8559, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/860398ffcbfece17a613ab2edeffcc5f/5B7A4846/t51.2885-15/e15/10454236_1436469629954891_21742662_n.jpg"}, {"tags": ["#mirror", "#justintimberlake"], "date": "2016-01-13T18:40:58.000Z", "comments": 25, "description": "\ud83c\udfa4 ....I'm lookin right at the other half of me...\ud83c\udfa4\n", "likes": 24223, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/7010c491178213b1d20a9eb105649e0c/5B5C5459/t51.2885-15/e35/10349825_485237514996066_1767633332_n.jpg"}, {"tags": ["#flosanity"], "date": "2015-04-04T19:54:44.000Z", "comments": 25, "description": "Here is Ginger's participation on teaming up with @Progressive for ", "likes": 11484, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/643942e0f3c57a6e806cdec07bb9bf7a/5AE45ADC/t51.2885-15/e15/11138042_1399198663732249_883734971_n.jpg"}, {"tags": ["#tbt"], "date": "2018-03-08T21:53:53.000Z", "comments": 25, "description": "", "likes": 29794, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/a0cc6b1f4ad94a92ef5341ff1f3abab3/5B7BF3F2/t51.2885-15/e35/28158997_203545530241879_849835167290753024_n.jpg"}, {"tags": ["#lovemysister", "#venus", "#ginger", "#video", "#TGIF"], "date": "2014-02-21T13:23:20.000Z", "comments": 25, "description": "Sweet girls, morning kisses!

A lot of it is human irresponsibility. Mama's been helping with spaying feral colonies but there's way more than she and all of the rescue people here can handle. It's a constant battle!

Together we are saving him and from the bottom of my heart and @goodkarmapetrescue's heart, thank you so very much!! \ud83d\udc9e\nWe will keep the updates coming as soon as the vet or Good Karma gets them to us.\nIf you'd like to donate towards his medical bills which are reaching up by the day, there is a link in the bio to donate directly to the rescue. Ok, so this pic is Trenton, his brother who did nothing but hiss and growl protecting Trey (and meowing for him aaallll night looknnnngg last night looking for him) til mid day today when he decided to give me a chance. After a few minutes of head strokes he was on his back fully submissive as if he were a house cat. And until Wednesday I don't think he's ever been touched by a human hand. Now that he knows the love we have to give, you can't walk into the room without him wanting to be on you. He will be available for adoption hopefully with Trey as a duo.

I couldn't think of a story more special and inspiring than Roo's. @roothekangaroocat \ud83d\ude3a .\nRoo was born with genetic abnormalities & was rescued by someone who witnessed him cruelly being thrown into a lake. He was adopted out shortly after, still a kitten.\nThree years later he was returned emaciated. He was missing patches of fur, skittish, & in an adoption room surrounded by gorgeous cats.\nHe sat at the shelter, skipped over for 6 months until we met him, and fell in love with all of the reasons that one person literally threw him away & another neglected him, returning him like a defective product. Where they saw deformities & some neurological challenges we saw uniqueness, a sweet personality that was dying to be loved, & a cat that deserved a chance.\nHe has a condition called radial hypoplasia which is why his front legs are bent, & has abnormally large rear legs so he can stand up steady. He has crossed eyes, big ears, & a crooked tail but we \u2764\ufe0f all of those things about him! We chose him for the very reasons others looked away.\nHe was very skittish when we first got him but he looks so much different & has gone from a scared boy to a very affectionate trusting/friendly boy who jumps at every chance to occupy lap space. His purrs are so self rewarding & a daily reminder of how one man's trash can be another's treasure.\nWe hope Roo's story has inspired you to consider adopting a \"special needs\" pet. As much as we've changed his life, he's also changed ours. He has proven that something so beautiful can lie beneath an \"imperfect\" exterior. We feel like the lucky ones in this happy ending. \ud83d\ude3a\ud83d\ude03\ud83d\udc3e\ud83d\udc9e .\nJoin us in celebrating Petfinder's 20th anniversary by sharing your special adoption story.

I decided to keep them separate because I don't want a fight to break out or Trey to get stressed out especially having only 1 front paw to defend himself with.\nDr. Simon says he is completely recovered and ready for adoption. Trenton is also ready for adoption. Because they are no longer bonded they do not have to be adopted together. If they are, they would probably become bonded again but that's not the case right now.\nAll applications should go to @goodkarmapetrescue and I do believe transport can be arranged.\nNot sure how the sore on his ear happened but it is healing and doesn't seem to bother him.\nBoth are litter trained and super lovable. He has no problem walking, running, or getting in and out of the litter box.\nIf you are interested in adopting please fill out an application even if you're not in Florida. If you have any questions please direct them to @goodkarmapetrescue.\nThis little guy is so special. With your support he was able to get through 4 surgeries and is a healthy little tripod kitty now. He is alive today thanks to the young man who saw him & reported it when his co-workers seemed to not care, @goodkarmapetrescue stepping up, agreeing to take him into the rescue (which means taking on any vet bills that come with him), Dr. Simon and staff for going above and beyond with top notch treatment and care, and all of you who donated to @goodkarmapetrescue to help cover his bills!\nWe've been hands on in a few saves like this but this one was the most critical and touched me the most with the way you guys came through when donations were needed. This was a group effort and I'm so pleased to be posting this happy ending.\nNow, the next happy ending will be when he and Trenton find their Furever families.

Mojo & Venus both were rescued by us the same year just months apart in 2009. He was around a year old and she was just a couple months old. They grew fond of each other quickly & have always been close.\nWhat we can tell you factually as we don't have the technical terms yet is that last night we noticed he had a deep but short/labored breathing pattern. We took him to the emergency clinic immediately. His O2 saturation was 71 & he started to breath with an open mouth. He was put in an oxygen chamber where he was stabilized enough to get an X-Ray. His insides were full of fluid, had an enlarged heart, fluid around the heart itself also & the prognosis was that his condition (heart related) was beyond being able to save him. When he was brought to us so we could hold him as he was humanely put to rest he had only been out of the oxygen chamber for a few moments & he started gasping & started to die right there so the solution was injected into his IV immediately so he could go in peace surrounded by love. It was a much quicker goodbye than we had hoped for but that is how quickly this condition went from \"something isn't right\" to lethal. I've said it before & I want to reiterate. Please, if you notice anything change about your cat's behavior DO NOT WAIT...get them to a vet ASAP! In our case we did catch it early & took immediate action but it wouldn't have made a difference in his case as his condition was inoperable. If we hadn't taken him when we did he would've died overnight alone while we slept. However, often times you CAN catch treatable conditions if you seek medical attention quickly. I wish his was treatable because we would've done whatever was necessary to save him. It was so hard to say goodbye!\nMojo we love & miss you so much! We hope that sharing your story will help someone else's pet get early detection as more people become aware of how important it is to watch for behavior changes and act quickly.

This is Monkey. \ud83d\ude4a She got her name from how much she loves to climb. She and her siblings, Moo & Nugget had just turned 6 weeks old whe this pic which was taken in May '15. They were born in our home because we took in their very feral mama to foster when she was very pregnant and set up a birthing area in a large dog cage. Mama was eventually returned to her colony as she wasn't friendly and would actually try to attack. She was TNR'd (trap, neuter/spay, return) when the kittens were old enough to also be spayed and adopted out. Unlike Mama they were super sweet, playful, and friendly. They all got great homes and mama is still seen by the person who feeds her colony and is doing fine as she was before. If she had her kittens in the colony she was in, their fate would've probably been very different.\nFostering is so much fun & rewarding! If you've never done it you should try it! The rescues and shelters never have enough and you can make a difference! \ud83d\udc9e\nHappy Friday everyone!! \ud83d\ude3d\ud83d\ude3d\n", "likes": 33333, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/23262627e3473dbfe9b0415ba28b4513/5B657927/t51.2885-15/e35/12135146_199277680446510_1456997364_n.jpg"}, {"tags": ["#adoptdontshop"], "date": "2016-07-15T00:59:51.000Z", "comments": 25, "description": "\ud83d\ude3f Nobody has submitted an application to adopt these guys. \ud83d\ude3f\n****Link in bio for adoption app ****\nMost of you know Trey's story. So much time, effort, and $ was put into saving him so they really need a very special home. Honestly you'd be lucky to have them and I'm going to have a hard time with this goodbye.\nHere's what I can tell you about their personalities.\nThey are both SUPER SWEET love bugs! Trey is very docile and less playful and active but he can pretty much do anything Trenton can. He just prefers to cuddle.\nTrenton, having all 4 of his legs is an energetic playful kitten who is very entertaining but also super sweet. Big lap kitty! Doesn't scratch or bite, neither do.\nThey are both litter trained, neutered, love human affection, and are very lovable.\nNeither have naughty habits in fact, Trenton already knows when you sit down with a plate of food and say \"no\" that means no. He'll lay down a few feet away and not persist. This took a little training. Trey has never begged for food and is less likely to bother you at the table or countertops because he can only jump so high with 3 legs. He can climb a cat tower or jump up onto your lap but that's about it.\nSo who are these guys going to be lucky enough to adopt and make their Furever human? Please put in an app at @goodkarmapetrescue if interested. Transport CAN be arranged if not in Florida, just ask.\nCome on guys....lets keep them in the family with someone here taking them. It would be great to keep up with his progress as he grows. He's gone through so much and both of these guys deserve a great home! And trust me, you'll be getting two really cute lovable cats. Please tag someone you know who might be interested.\nWho's it gonna be? \ud83d\ude3a\nPlease direct habit/personality questions at me and adoption related questions to @goodkarmapetrescue. Thanks everyone! Let's finish their story with a happy ending adoption! \ud83d\ude3d\n", "likes": 30530, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/a44d2f40189305a4d9c1dfff94b5fa6b/5B6C12C3/t51.2885-15/e35/13743174_376160699175044_504713768_n.jpg"}, {"tags": [], "date": "2013-01-01T05:16:23.000Z", "comments": 25, "description": "Happy New Year!! <3 Venus & Family", "likes": 2196, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/c753e520e072a3741821ae5c15547fc7/5B671103/t51.2885-15/e15/11256339_627805837354572_464179710_n.jpg"}, {"tags": ["#halloween", "#ellendegeneres", "#girlswithties", "#theellenshow", "#venus", "#venusandellen", "#happyhalloween"], "date": "2013-10-28T17:34:21.000Z", "comments": 11, "description": "Who said girls can't rock ties?!

He'll be monitored tomorrow and as soon as the doctor feels he's stable enough for surgery they will be removing the scapula as it is infected.\nFor now he is resting comfortably. This could not have waited until morning so although pet emergency centers are more expensive, we do what we have to do to save a life.\nWe trapped & are fostering these guys but @goodkarmapetrescue stepped up & is accepting as adoptees which means they are also paying the bills.\nIf you would like to donate, the link is in the bio. More info can be found on the previous post.\nThanks everyone for your support for this little guy! I'll continue to give updates! Meanwhile, his brother is here with us not very happy that he is missing and very worried about him. He keeps meowing for him and looking around, very vocal!

On this day, 9/21/13 we almost lost Venus from something totally preventable and we want to share her story with you in the hopes that it will spread awareness and save lives. When this post was shared in 2013 that's exactly what happened. We got a lot of comments and inbox messages that due to having read the info in the post about Venus's story, people were able to recognize the signs that something was wrong with their pet & in turn save their pet's life. It's too long to post here so I've put the link to her FB page in the bio. All posts are public so I don't think you need to have a Fb account to be able to read the posts. Please read and share this info. This isn't about likes or shares, it's about awareness and saving lives and it works! This day brings back one of the scariest & saddest days of my life not knowing for the first 48 hours if she would pull through but also makes me so very grateful that she was able to be saved and is still here with us today. Thanks everyone! XOXO \ud83d\ude3d\ud83d\ude3d\ud83d\ude3d*****added info:\nA lot of people who didn't go to or can't go to Facebook are asking what happened and I guess I left that out. The story is detailed in Facebook but the short short version is she suffered a complete urinary blockage which is almost unheard of in females. Both males and females get urinary tract infections but usually only males get blocked. She had to be this way for 4 days with a catheter and IV with weeks of extra meds and complications but made a full recovery. Thanks for asking and thanks to all who have shared your stories, advice, kind words, etc. What you shared may save someone's pet's life. \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude3d", "likes": 16679, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/9921caafdb8edea4be2d89c690bfbcab/5B6BEC59/t51.2885-15/e35/11254136_1484323208560820_2126379681_n.jpg"}, {"tags": [], "date": "2015-02-17T18:56:47.000Z", "comments": 25, "description": "Cats & hearts....what more do you need on a tie? \ud83d\udc08\ud83d\udc97", "likes": 18120, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/2a9d832921820781d7cff008f081f818/5B9BD5EC/t51.2885-15/e15/11008296_1442129019411364_1558035608_n.jpg"}, {"tags": ["#tbt"], "date": "2014-10-30T17:30:42.000Z", "comments": 25, "description": "", "likes": 15674, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/b00713ee1bad75579ecf452880826694/5B788C2C/t51.2885-15/e15/1515920_373077049522732_1855715583_n.jpg"}, {"tags": ["#sisterfeud", "#catfight", "#jealousy"], "date": "2014-08-08T17:14:03.000Z", "comments": 25, "description": "\ud83d\ude3e Ginger didn't think I would find out about this.

We know that cats leave prey (presents) for their owners but do other animals, wildlife give the same reciprocation? Tell us what you think. \ud83d\udc3fWe've been leaving peanuts out for the squirrels since we moved here as we did in Florida. Here though, the cats, specifically Venus have a front row view from the step they come up on and spend hours watching them come up. They are not scared. While we were watching with her this morning, this little gal came from the wooded preserve behind our house with some kind of grape size nut in her mouth. We've been watching the squirrels bury some of the peanuts so when she came out of the trees we thought she was going to the yard to bury it.

She was actually back to herself two days following the surgery. She has adjusted to having only one eye so well and her fur will soon grow in the rest of the way. This pic was just taken today.\nFor those who don't know the story, Halo had a watery and squinty eye one morning and was taken to the vet the same day. That vet diagnosed her with conjunctivitis and we followed his treatment plan. After a week of not seeing significant improvement and Halo seeming to be in more pain, I took her for a 2nd opinion. She was diagnosed with glaucoma which progressed extremely quickly to the point of it now being an emergency. We then went to the emergency vet who confirmed the diagnosis. The eye was tested for vision and there was no response. Glaucoma had already blinded that eye and she was clearly in much more pain than even the day before. There was no saving the eye so we followed the ophthalmologists advice to remove the eye and relieve Halo of her pain. Surgery was done just hours later and it was so nice seeing her relaxed and not in pain anymore.\nShe has recovered so nicely but we have to give her drops daily and watch the other eye because the biopsy came back that it was primary glaucoma. Shiba Inus are genetically predisposed to this and most often by the time you notice symptoms it's already BAD. If you have a dog please read up on glaucoma and what to watch for. I hope by sharing Halo's story it will save someone else's dog from going through this. Also, veterinarians, please please please do a pressure test when dogs present eye problems. She may have still lost the eye if the 1st vet caught it but we could've saved her a week of pain, suffering, and aggravation with us putting drops in her eyes 2x per day treating the wrong thing. You Shiba owners know exactly what I'm talking about.\nThank you all so much for your thoughts and support. \ud83d\ude3d\ud83d\ude3d\n", "likes": 40067, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/b4c57fa61e494f3e9fa4a2153c18a9a4/5B7DEB59/t51.2885-15/e35/14712351_1862007867364371_3912342566703464448_n.jpg"}, {"tags": ["#proudtobeafosterfail", "#spayandneuter", "#adoptdontshop"], "date": "2015-10-17T21:47:21.000Z", "comments": 25, "description": "Foster failure is when you are fostering and you can't let go.

Ok, here's all the info:\nThe other cat IS in fact a real cat and her name is Whiskeyanne. I believe she lives in Tennessee. I tracked down her owner & spoke to her when Venus's page was first built and I saw this same pic of her. She IS a mirror image with the colors reversed. According to her owner she is about 10lbs (twice the size of Venus). They are about a year apart in age. She was also found as a stray. Whiskeyanne does have a bigger white \"bib\" and also has white paws. Her body is more calico coloring than torti. Her whiskers are all white whereas Venus's are white on the orange side & black on the black side. Her line appears to stop at her upper lip where Venus's goes all the way down her neck to her small white \"bib\" which is the only white she has on her. Whiskeyanne has some black on the orange side of her face above the eye where Venus's is all orange with a straighter line. Whiskeyanne's ears match while Venus's ears are the same color of that side of her face. According to her owner she is very sweet just like Venus. I think it's fascinating that these 2 look so much alike with the most likenesses as any other cat I've seen. I think she's beautiful and am hoping maybe the 2 can meet for a photo together one day. I hope you guys enjoyed this and some of you picked out the whisker color difference which I didn't think anyone would get. Good job!! Click like if you think they're fascinating & think they should go to the popular page for everyone to enjoy!

He was rescued by someone who witnessed someone else throwing him away like trash into a lake in a plastic bag likely because he was not normal like the rest of the litter. Luckily this other person saw this happen & brought him to @florida_humane_society where they adopted him out as a kitten.\nThree years later he was returned by those adopters in very bad shape, emaciated. He was missing patches of fur and we recently noticed (if you compare to recent pics) that his \"pouch\" has fur on it now & all of his fur is more shiny & fluffy . When we got him we didn't think there ever was fur there.\nHe sat at Florida Humane Society for 6 months until we went there met him, and fell in love with all of the reasons that one person literally threw him away (probably the deformed kitten of a litter) and another neglected him and ultimately returned him like a bad product. Where they saw deformities and some neurological challenges we saw uniqueness, a sweet personality that was dying to be loved, and a cat that deserved a chance. He was very skittish when we first got him (almost a year ago) but he looks so much different and has gone from a scared boy that would hide all day and jump & scatter every time you walked by him to a very affectionate trusting and friendly boy who jumps at every chance to occupy lap space. He is so content and happy and his purrs are a daily reminder of how one man's trash can be another's treasure.\nHe has radial hypoplasia which is why his front legs are bent, abnormally large rear legs to compensate so he can stand up steady, crossed eyes, big ears, a big crooked tail that was most likely broken after birth, and we LOVE all of those things about him!\nWe fell in love with all the reasons someone else thought he was trash and that he didn't deserve to live.\n", "likes": 51213, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/7628ca478d82450a4bc61c5a2ebda7e6/5B5B70ED/t51.2885-15/e35/12552439_961088817273360_112653894_n.jpg"}, {"tags": ["#venustwofacecat", "#venus", "#venuscat", "#instacat", "#instagood", "#instapets", "#catsofinstagram", "#hypnotize", "#eyes", "#wow"], "date": "2013-03-02T17:15:09.000Z", "comments": 25, "description": "Look into my eyes, DEEP into my eyes....now, when I say \"meow\" you will bring me all the cat treats I desire! \"MEOW\" ", "likes": 7195, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/fa9f391061b93f171617b600b8e1c42e/5B98B903/t51.2885-15/e15/11232777_763147327139529_927161760_n.jpg"}, {"tags": ["#instanomcat", "#instanomcat", "#venus", "#roo", "#gamers"], "date": "2015-05-13T16:13:34.000Z", "comments": 25, "description": "Attention Venus & Roo fans: Time for a fun high score competition!

It's amazing how they know when something is wrong.\nIf you missed the last post, Halo had her 2nd eye removed today due to primary glaucoma leading to an extreme overnight change in pressures we've been managing with drops. All of the sudden it went from the drops being a life changer to the glaucoma progressing in hyper speed overnight spiking pressure & causing pain. The last post gives more details & like always, I want to use our unfortunate incident to spread awareness about this nasty disease. Please please please google glaucoma in cats/dogs & become familiar with the symptoms which are extremely subtle & hard to notice in early stages. Often times by the time you notice something it's too late. It's different from humans & the way we can manage it & keep it at bay for years.\nI want to give a big thank you to Animal Emergency Center Rochester & staff for taking such good care of her again as an emergency when the eye specialist couldn't fit her in & also for being so patient & understanding, taking extra time to explain everything. It's over now & she can just put it behind her & recover.\nAnother big thank you to all of you for sending love, positive vibes, prayers, & for sharing your own stories of this same scenario happening to you and how your blind dog is thriving. We needed that encouragement because we feel so bad for her. \ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude3f\nYou guys are the best & made this a whole lot easier to deal with today with all the love. \ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude3d\nWe are prepared to give her the extra attention she'll need while adjusting to being blind & navigating around the house.\nAgain, please familiarize yourself with glaucoma especially if you have a breed who is known for being genetically predisposed. Shiba Inus aren't on those lists but just about everyone we've been to says they see it in Shibas all the time so even if your dog isn't on the list know the signs anyway. Don't dismiss a watery eye for seasonal allergies. It could be as simple as that or the start of glaucoma. Better to check pressures and catch it early if it is the onset of glaucoma.\nThanks again everyone!\nXOXO \ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude3d\n", "likes": 26810, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/0082b38d38916b5c00fc7487e2e2372a/5B67A4A2/t51.2885-15/e35/19228848_1786964304877548_6421644516100407296_n.jpg"}, {"tags": ["#catlife", "#venus"], "date": "2015-09-01T18:32:21.000Z", "comments": 25, "description": ".....Daydreaming \ud83d\udcad\ud83d\udcad\ud83d\udcad\n", "likes": 20670, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/43773a479f02d8cf667229f91f21db7c/5B7E61B4/t51.2885-15/e35/11909163_600246550117144_1274652310_n.jpg"}, {"tags": ["#supercloseup"], "date": "2014-04-24T03:55:06.000Z", "comments": 25, "description": "This is what happens when a 5 yr old sneaks the camera away to take pics.

Thanks everyone! \ud83d\ude3d\ud83d\ude3d\nPoor Halo \ud83d\ude1e. She has a suspected eye infection and isn't her usual self. Her eye became squinty and watery yesterday and the vet found her eye to be very cloudy but didn't see any scratches or trauma. Anyone who knows the Shiba-Inu breed knows the struggle of trying to closely examine anything on them so we have drops for her eye (which amazingly we were successful with sneaking in both doses today) and are hoping it's nothing more serious. She's 7 and glaucoma is apparently common in her breed which we're praying it's not! So please keep her in your Purrrayers. We just want her to feel better, she seems so sad. If it seems worse tomorrow she'll see the vet again. This morning it was swollen and goopy. Now she has a cone on so she doesn't wipe at it with her paw. Hoping we see some improvement tomorrow. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\nGoodnight everyone!

His scapula was removed due to infection along with some necrotic tissue. Everything was cleaned out thoroughly and he is on a strong antibiotic and pain meds. This has been such a rough week for him with major surgeries. This is a lot for a 3 month old kitten but he is a fighter and so far things look significantly more promising than Saturday night when I first posted about him. Please see that post for his story. \ud83d\udc3e\nHe'll be monitored around the clock for the next few days to make sure he's stable and to keep an eye on drainage/infection. Hopefully the worst is behind him so he can just heal and get ready to come back to us soon to reunite with his brother. \ud83d\udc6c\nKeep the purrrayers and good vibes coming. Your support and compassion for this little guy is felt by many and so touching!\nHe is putting up one heck of a fight and we will all continue to fight for him together. \ud83d\udc9e\nI'll keep the updates coming as I get them.\nThank you all for showing me, my family, Trey, @goodkarmapetrescue , his vet, surgical team, and everyone else pulling for him that generosity and kindness is still alive and well with all of the negative things that are going on in the world. To see so many people come together to save the life of a kitten they don't even know is more moving than I can find words for especially since he became this critical because the people that did this (accidentally) didn't think his life was important enough to call out for help for him. They let him hobble around for at least a weekend before a brave young man working there found out about it & spoke up for him.\nI'm honored to have such an inspirational story to share and we couldn't have come this far without your help! \ud83d\ude3d\ud83d\ude18\n", "likes": 30076, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/0bffbd0909611f9033947b2e2b2f3548/5B9CBDFC/t51.2885-15/e35/13381423_620911231419245_120655862_n.jpg"}, {"tags": ["#305", "#Dolfan", "#Seahawks", "#superbowl", "#superbowl2015", "#seattle", "#seahawks", "#gohawks"], "date": "2015-01-21T23:02:43.000Z", "comments": 25, "description": "Look what came in the mail today!

They are so tough and good at hiding pain, by the time they show symptoms it's often too late with some of these diseases and illnesses. This was the case with Mojo. Playing that morning, labored breathing that night with an enlarged heart and fluid throughout his chest.

The only \"off\" thing we noticed was one of the 3 cats was peeing in random places but we thought it was behavioral because of foster kittens in the house. Learning from experience, if we could go back in time we would have taken all 3 in to be checked. We assumed it was territorial marking & we were wrong! Never assume, always get them checked. We were fortunate that we found her when we did & her vet saved her life after 4 days in the hospital. \ud83d\ude4f\nThis mentality was helpful with Halo just recently who had a watery eye that she was squinting. We didn't waste time even though we could've assumed it was just an allergy or something that got in her eye. We got her to the vet the same day.

Just heard from the vet and we have good news and bad. Bandit (black kitty) crossed the rainbow bridge. \ud83d\ude3f\ud83d\ude3f\nHe fought like a trooper but in the end his little body just couldn't fight off everything he was dealing with. This is the first time we've lost a kitten and our hearts are heavy. I see this in rescue posts a lot where even seemingly healthy kittens die unexpectedly because they could have unknown underlying diseases like FIV or FELV or a host of other hidden complications. The cards may have been stacked against him from the start but we gave him a fighting chance & never gave up. R.I.P. pain free little guy! \ud83d\ude22\ud83c\udf08\nOn the brighter side, his brother, Smokey is improving, vibrant and playful. His outcome is much more promising & he already weighs more. He will remain at the vet in treatment through the weekend.\nAs heartbroken as I am over my first rescue loss, my heart is warmed by the outpouring of love and donations for these guys!\nSo thank you again and I will post another update as soon as I have one.

He was rescued by someone who witnessed someone else throwing him away like trash into a lake in a plastic bag likely because he was not normal like the rest of the litter. Luckily this other person saw this happen & brought him to @florida_humane_society where they adopted him out as a kitten.\nThree years later he was returned by those adopters in very bad shape, emaciated. He was missing patches of fur and we recently noticed (if you compare to recent pics) that his \"pouch\" has fur on it now. When we got him we didn't think there ever was fur there.\nHe sat at Florida Humane Society for 6 months until we went there met him, and fell in love with all of the reasons that one person literally threw him away (probably the deformed kitten of a litter) and another neglected him and ultimately returned him like a bad product. Where they saw deformities and some neurological challenges we saw uniqueness, a sweet personality that was dying to be loved, and a cat that deserved a chance. He was very skittish when we first got him (almost a year ago) but he looks so much different and has gone from a scared boy that would hide all day and jump & scatter every time you walked by him to a very affectionate trusting and friendly boy who jumps at every chance to occupy lap space. He is so content and happy and his purrs are a daily reminder of how one man's trash can be another's treasure.\nHe has radial hypoplasia which is why his front legs are bent, abnormally large rear legs to compensate so he can stand up steady, crossed eyes, big ears, a big crooked tail that was most likely broken after birth, and we LOVE all of those things about him!\nWe fell in love with all the reasons someone else thought he was trash and that he didn't deserve to live.\n", "likes": 36121, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/619b0283341a62277323b465c741055d/5B5EA55F/t51.2885-15/e35/12317709_871453429638192_226579211_n.jpg"}, {"tags": ["#Video", "#facebook"], "date": "2015-01-06T04:46:18.000Z", "comments": 25, "description": "\ud83d\udc9c Buddy update \ud83d\udc9c\n", "likes": 15839, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/e53758496afa4c27e902e0e4cc89d8f2/5B6103B3/t51.2885-15/e15/10881739_1579466225623703_1136504190_n.jpg"}, {"tags": ["#sexy", "#venus", "#instagood", "#catsofinstagram", "#beautiful", "#cat", "#cute", "#thisismysexypose"], "date": "2014-02-02T04:56:35.000Z", "comments": 25, "description": "\ud83c\udfb6I'm sexy and I know it \ud83c\udfb6\n", "likes": 5617, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/4c7d16f8bb983ad5e462270090c47ea3/5B96A90F/t51.2885-15/e15/1741282_210019802525874_371824717_n.jpg"}, {"tags": ["#soflo", "#climaterollercoaster"], "date": "2014-12-24T01:47:59.000Z", "comments": 25, "description": "\"Helping\" sort laundry.

ROO...that's who! :) Meet the newest member of our family. After Mojo's unexpected passing we visited Florida Humane Society\ufeff to give them a donation. We were not planning to adopt another cat but you know how that goes...... While we were there we spotted Roo standing upright as you see him in the pic. With his special legs, crossed eyes, and his story we fell in love. After really giving it some thought (due to just losing Mojo) we brought him home a week after meeting him. That was exactly 4 weeks ago. Today we officially adopted him & made him a forever part of our family after 4 weeks of fostering/monitoring & getting him adjusted to make sure everyone (furkids) was going to get along. It's been a very humbling & rewarding experience watching him grow from being scared to come out from under a chair to a kitty that comes to you when you call him and LOVES to snuggle. Every day he lets his guard down and trusts us a little more. I would say now that he is pretty settled. Here's his story.\nRoo's life started out being born with a genetic mutation called Radial Hypoplasia also known as \"twisty cat\" or \"kangaroo cat syndrome\" hence his name (which we will keep the same because he answers to it) although we've given his name double meaning as he wakes us up right at dawn daily like clockwork like a rooster. He stands on his hind legs (very steadily & balanced) to stop and look around and walks on his elbows. He actually runs quite well.\nSee more of his story on ", "likes": 24197, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/62970d6676d7a80eb40b9b490582eb91/5B67B90F/t51.2885-15/e15/10848403_728531723903463_1329793245_n.jpg"}, {"tags": [], "date": "2017-05-25T01:36:47.000Z", "comments": 25, "description": "Pssssst!

This will give us another chance to spread the importance of adopting and rescuing along with spaying and neutering. So after a loooong nap together today & some snuggle time we are refreshed and ready to do it again! Very excited to keep sharing her, her story, and the mission behind all of this.

Thanks again and if you want to watch, it is on the Fox network and our scheduled appearance time is 7:20ish. I'll be on my laptop for the next 45 minutes or so, so if you want to ask questions please do in the comment section and I'll try my best to answer them all.

Btw, this is as close as anyone should get to wearing real fur!! This is Trenton, Trey's brother and this is his favorite place to be if he's not on your lap. When he wasn't eating for a few days about a week ago and not feeling well I kept him warm like this. It started from me carrying him one time and needing both hands to reach something. I needed somewhere to put him so I stuck him in my top which has a built in shelf bra so he wouldn't fall through. He stayed there, purred, and fell asleep. So it's become a thing now....and this is the kitten that did nothing but hiss and growl at me for the first few days he was in our home. It may have been because he started feeling sick or sad when Trey went to the pet ER & maybe decided to give me a chance or needed comfort. Whatever it was, this is the biggest transformation in a feral I have ever experienced. He is such a mush!! I'm sure Trey will be the same from being handled so much by the vet and staff.

I miss these boys so much and am so happy their human started an Instagram for them so we can keep seeing them grow. We love that they got adopted together to such a great family! Their account is @trey_plus_trenton if you'd like to continue following these 2 cuties! They have such a great story from when we trapped them at about 8 weeks of age due to Trey's leg having been literally ripped off in a golf cart accident where management didn't think his life meant enough to get him help because he was \"just a stray\". Luckily a concerned animal lover called out for help and were able to come to their rescue with the help of @goodkarmapetrescue , @drsimonspetclinic and of course, many of you who donated towards his surgeries. These guys did nothing but hiss and growl and then decided to give us a chance. They literally went from feral to full mush, rolling onto their backs for belly rubs within minutes of the first trusting touch on their terms. This still remains one of my favorite hands on saves!\nTo follow their journey from the start, scroll back to June 28th to the first picture of Trey in an incubator with a bandage on his body.

Please friends, donate if you can. Oh, you can choose NOT to pay the optional operating cost fee by hitting \"edit this amount\" and selecting zero. This is a solo volunteer operation and I cannot fund it without your help.

The more $ raised, the more animals we can help when we encounter these situations.

Had to be bottle fed every few hours just like a newborn human baby and manually stimulated to pee/poop at those feedings. Enjoy the multiple pics (keep swiping) & walk down memory lane to my youngest kitten rescue (no graphic pics). \ud83d\ude3b\n\nWho could forget Buddy if you've been following since 2014?? We were asked to help a few day old kitten who had been thrown out of a car window. We got him with his eyes closed, burnt paw pads from the hot South Florida pavement, and a little scrawny lacerated tail. Buddy lost his tail as a result but thrived each week and ended up a handsome, strapping 22 lb tall and muscular \"bobtail\" cat. He's far from obese, just a huge frame and tall. He has a wonderful home now not far from where he was rescued from the street and is all grown up. He lives with 2 little girls who dress him up, tuck him in a baby doll bed, and push him around in a pink stroller. He loves every minute of it even though he's so masculine.\nFostering him & nursing him back to health was a wonderful self rewarding family experience. Cases like this is why we dive in hands on when we can and why we donate to rescue when we can. My own kids even helped hand on and have been since...little rescuers in training!\nThere are so many animals that need our help so please open your home to foster if you can! Sometimes rescues who are full will take on more if they have foster homes available. It's usually an issue of space, not $. My friend Hannah @kittenxlady has made kitten rescue her whole life!

He was neutered the first day and his wounds were treated along with a cortisone shot and Antibiotic injection while under anesthesia. These pics were taken over a 4 day period. He has since gone to a rescue friend who is experienced with handling ferals (he is very feral) for further treatment (eye drops and more vet visits) to heal his face before returning him to his colony. TNR isn't all about trap, spay/neuter, & return. Sometimes you get a case like this where you get to make a much more positive difference in their life than just sterilizing. Can you imagine the pain this poor boy was in? If you have a little spare time on your hands & want a self rewarding experience in an area that so desperately needs help, contact a local no-kill rescue to ask about volunteering to TNR. Cat overpopulation is so out of control that your contribution could make a huge difference. Have a great day everyone! \ud83d\ude3d Will post an update on this baby when he's all healed up. Look at those gorgeous green eyes that were under all of that painful mess. A great big HUGE thank you to Nicole and Suzanne for stepping in to further treat him & to Sharon, the business owner where the cats have been coming for food, for caring enough to NOT call animal control & instead reaching out to local rescues for not just him but another stray that needed TNR also which has been done. \ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc9a\n", "likes": 12359, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/2943c91b3005bab34f4df932f99eaa01/5B7ADB94/t51.2885-15/e15/11260434_1597107840576359_2102822641_n.jpg"}, {"tags": ["#peekaboo"], "date": "2015-11-28T18:17:32.000Z", "comments": 25, "description": "Jack has a thing for paper bags\n", "likes": 22680, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/6de9c3c1fd94279e3e3db31e6c4fd387/5B6AEB5A/t51.2885-15/e35/12299064_150098552014991_1383519087_n.jpg"}, {"tags": ["#caturday", "#catproblems", "#catlife", "#diva", "#spoiled"], "date": "2017-01-28T17:50:23.000Z", "comments": 25, "description": "Waiting for your breakfast like....\n", "likes": 30491, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/8f0f7fb4216557d16c70dbd19c816976/5B7D9EAF/t51.2885-15/e35/16229406_186098461868885_302079936284327936_n.jpg"}, {"tags": ["#Roo", "#spoiled", "#crosseyed", "#radialhypoplasia"], "date": "2015-09-16T18:00:28.000Z", "comments": 25, "description": "Nnnoooooo!!

I know when we went through her blockage it drained us emotionally, physically, & financially. A lot of you offered to help with expenses but we didn't accept it so we thought maybe you could help Oscar instead. This caught our eye because he looks like Mojo AND I know the pain Oscar and his family are going through along with the financial worries we went through on top of it all.\nI normally don't do this because I can't help everyone with fund accounts and I don't like to have to choose, but this post happened to be in the right place at the right time hitting so very close to home with the exact same thing Venus suffered almost exactly a year ago.\nJust like fan art, this was chosen completely by chance, at random & spontaneously as you can imagine, we get lots of requests to share a fund post. No pet is more important than another which is why we normally don't post these. We don't want anyone to feel like we looked over their request and don't want to flood the feed with \"can you help\" posts. But with this hitting so close to home in 2 ways I felt compelled to break my own rules, share this, and ask you to go to his page bio & click the GoFundMe link if you can spare a donation. No amount is too small and if you can't give monetary support please at least keep Oscar and his family in your thoughts and prayers. We feel horrible for this family and the pain that Oscar and his humans are in. It's a horrible thing to go through. His mama is going through what we went through and we want to be able to ease the pain a little by giving her one less thing to worry about by helping with Oscar's expenses. Your condolences and kind words have been so helpful in our grieving the loss of Mojo. Maybe if nothing else you can leave a little supportive thoughtful comment or well wishes on his post like you have been doing for us. It will put a smile on her face at the very least.

It's also not to insinuate that all declawed cats will have issues...we don't want to deter anyone from adopting a declawed cat.\nIt's been said that declawed cats become biters. Well, 11 yrs ago, before we became educated on what declawing really is, we had Ginger's front claws removed as the vet recommended as a combo while she was being spayed. This was a very common recommendation & procedure coupled with spaying/neutering and in many veterinarians in the United States, still is. \ud83d\ude3f\ud83d\udc4e Again, this was before our involvement in rescue and before so much light has been shed on the truth. Hindsight is 20/20 and that said, we were wrong and learned from our mistake. Ginger IS a biter and we often wonder what other long term consequential side effects she might have suffered because of our ignorance. \ud83d\ude3f\nShe was the last cat we ever had that procedure done on because we along with providing many scratch posts, we regularly trim the claws on the paws in this house with little to no resistance from the kitties attached to those paws.\ud83d\udc3e\nPlease see the repost info below from @citythekitty who is on a mission to end this cruel and unnecessary practice just as many countries have already banned. \ud83d\ude3a\ud83d\udc3e\nThanks for your dedication @citythekitty.

Quick FAQ answers:\n**edit....forgot to mention they are in South Florida** They were born in front of people that work at the county park the colony is at so all they know is outdoors which is why they are skittish. The black ones are much less skittish (same litter so not sure why) & more friendly and trusting. The mother is all black & Dad is suspected to be a tux that hangs with the pack. I am not a rescue so I'm going to leave it up to my rescue friends as to if the Siamese pair can be socialized and domesticated for them to facilitate adoption. If they go up for adoption I will share them here so if you're interested you'll know who to contact. Again, we are not a rescue, just helping where help Is badly needed. Obviously we would rather see them placed in a home than to leave them to live in the wild although there are circumstances that cats will thrive best back in the habitat they already know. I'm not even sure of their gender because they're too scared to be handled and their tails cover the area I need to check. They are getting spayed/neutered tomorrow so we will know more then. There are more in that colony that need to be TNR'd so this is just the beginning. Tomorrow's post will have much more detailed information. I just had to share this pic based on some of the comments....those eyes....too cute!! \ud83d\ude3d\ud83d\ude09\ud83d\udc40\nHave a good night everyone!

Thankfully the other eye was 14 which is normal. The eye was unresponsive during a test and was confirmed to have no vision. Given the circumstances, the treatment plan recommended is removal of the eye. This is a very common scenario especially in certain breeds as I mentioned before. Even if she had vision it could be treated for a period of time but eventually would've had to be removed. There is no cure for Glaucoma, just management to control pressure. I also want to reiterate how quickly this can go from no symptoms at all to this severe. I like to share my experiences to hopefully help someone else. At the very first sign of eye trouble get to a vet!\nWe're sad that she's going to lose her eye and have to have surgery at all but relieved that she will no longer be in pain and will bounce back as we know how resilient our fur babies are.

Her eye wasn't improving much & this morning she was not herself and very vocal about it so went to another vet to get a 2nd opinion. She has glaucoma. \ud83d\ude3f\nThey referred us to an eye specialist and we came straight over and are waiting. We just want her eye pain to go away so she'll feel better. We really miss @drsimonspetclinic since we moved from Florida. We don't know anyone here since we moved so we're praying we're in the best hands. \ud83d\ude4f\nAs a PSA, I learned today how quickly something like this can sneak up out of nowhere so I'd like to share this with you for awareness. Please educate yourself about glaucoma if you have a dog and see which breeds are more prone. Shiba Inus happen to be one of them. It's not curable but if you catch it early you can save your fur baby a lot of pain.\nPlease say a little prayer for her as we don't know what the recommended treatment/course of action will be. We will choose the least bothersome treatment so she can feel better as soon as possible. We are also praying that the pressure isn't high on the other eye. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f", "likes": 22626, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/8669f403d9d9d934387b35b17eb4f502/5B98C88B/t51.2885-15/e35/14241084_351716325218885_1131030829_n.jpg"}, {"tags": ["#tbt", "#kitten", "#kittens", "#lilactortie", "#dilutetortie", "#tortoiseshell"], "date": "2018-04-06T01:54:43.000Z", "comments": 25, "description": "As promised from a post earlier today....My real life birth mama & litter mate sister ", "likes": 66902, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/8eeeef8c4f94e35b35c7ba5240555db1/5B7BEBC8/t51.2885-15/e35/29738861_1281206358649154_1475936039204814848_n.jpg"}, {"tags": ["#venus", "#venuscat", "#venustwofacecat", "#sleepy", "#cute", "#catsofinstagram", "#cats", "#instapets", "#instacat", "#chimera", "#goodnight"], "date": "2013-03-04T04:46:11.000Z", "comments": 25, "description": "Nite nite! \ud83d\ude3d\ud83c\udf19 ", "likes": 4190, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/b1e2fe4bc91fbc9768c6df599d0f5ea5/5B7DA41E/t51.2885-15/e15/11261955_375754989291973_676003482_n.jpg"}, {"tags": ["#VenusandRoo", "#friendsday", "#tbt"], "date": "2016-02-04T18:29:06.000Z", "comments": 25, "description": "Friends furever! \ud83d\udc9e\n", "likes": 38631, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/a667554eedc17e757fd8e241197f4802/5B5F9A67/t51.2885-15/e35/12568340_1688303341427006_1439459432_n.jpg"}, {"tags": ["#fbf", "#goodnight"], "date": "2015-10-24T03:16:48.000Z", "comments": 25, "description": "Goodnight! \ud83d\ude3d\ud83d\ude3d\ud83d\udca4 ", "likes": 26373, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/3a7b19569116c3195a5e7c8d23a7c091/5B6C682D/t51.2885-15/e35/12145101_554004724749665_448995608_n.jpg"}, {"tags": ["#brrr", "#staywarm", "#winterblues"], "date": "2017-12-11T19:12:44.000Z", "comments": 25, "description": "25 degrees F & snowing in Southeast Michigan - What\u2019s the weather like where you are? \u2744\ufe0f\ud83c\udf28\n", "likes": 44844, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/eafbea9e9d298b7edc9870c28165bff8/5B9CE733/t51.2885-15/e35/25013323_194691731094073_6392783491217489920_n.jpg"}, {"tags": ["#tbt"], "date": "2014-11-21T04:46:47.000Z", "comments": 25, "description": "", "likes": 14188, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/3b2f81ffaf6cc71226b184af0dac230e/5B6566FD/t51.2885-15/e15/10787888_756633681092526_1227635251_n.jpg"}, {"tags": ["#bathtime", "#aww", "#cute", "#venus"], "date": "2015-02-05T22:44:40.000Z", "comments": 25, "description": "Best place to take a bath?

She's much more confident and adventurous outdoors because she knows there are less things she can bump into. When she goes down our walkway you wouldn't even know she's blind without looking at her.\nIf you aren't familiar with glaucoma please learn about it. Halo is a Shiba Inu. \ud83d\udc15\nThey are not formally on the list of breeds known to be predisposed to glaucoma but the amount of cases of Shibas with glaucoma I know about say otherwise. Even if your dog isn't \"on the list\" you should familiarize yourself with this condition. Symptoms often present only when it's too late and people often mistake the symptoms as seasonal allergies.\nIf you are dealing with or have dealt with glaucoma in your pet please share your story here so we can spread awareness and hopefully save others from being caught off guard by sharing our experiences.

You are an inspiration & I want everyone who reads this to follow you & your YouTube channel in the hopes they can see how much fun it is fostering & how simple it can be if you just have a little bathroom space even to spare. I love your instructional videos & was very impressed by your workshop that I got to attend at @miamianimalserv when u were here in FL.\nIf u are a rescue or a shelter u should consider booking her for a workshop. It is so full of detailed information & you can use that workshop as a way to recruit new fosters which we all know are desperately in demand!\nLastly, reading through the comments of your post today was awesome when u asked everyone to name their favorite internet cat. It is so inspiring to see so many accounts, some I hadn't heard of til today, that are also active with TNR, adopting, fostering, & animal advocacy in general! I have some great new accounts to follow now who are as passionate about animals rescue as we are.

Mama will make another post before then to keep you posted. Happy Caturday everyone! \ud83d\ude3d\ud83d\ude3d\nOh, for everyone who asked about adopting Monkey, one of the foster kittens, (see last post) please contact @goodkarmapetrescue & click on the link in their bio. He won't be ready for adoption for a few weeks but you can still apply now.
