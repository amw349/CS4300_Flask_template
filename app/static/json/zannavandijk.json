On the left I was doing cardio every day, weighing and measuring everything I ate, having bland repetitive meals and feeling tired. I found training hard as I had no energy. My periods stopped. My boobs slowly disappeared (I love boobs \ud83d\ude02). In all honesty, I wasn't very healthy. I didn't have an eating disorder, I just thought that this was what it took to get lean. On the right I definitely don't have abs. However, I am eating a balanced and varied diet, I am able to eat out socially on a regular basis, my hormones are in check, I can train hard, I'm getting progressively stronger and most importantly I am happy. @alexjamesritson has shown me the value of flexibility. Now training and nutrition isn't my life, it is part of my life \ud83d\ude0a Sure you may be able to have abs and be super balanced, but you also may not.

I've always been an advocate of lifting weights, and I still am \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffc However a while ago I realised, sure I can lift weights but I can't lift my own body weight?! As my life has got busier and my training has become more eratic, I've had to let go of my regimented weight lifting routine. Don't get me wrong, I still lift and I love it. But I've been embracing short bodyweight workouts more and more since they fit in with my schedule. And you know what? I feel amazing. I used to avoid jumping lunges at all costs and collapse after a couple of reps. Now I can do them easily. I used to avoid burpees. Now I love them. (Yes, I love burpees \ud83d\ude02). I'm actually training LESS than I have in a long time. I used to be scared of reducing my weight training as I didn't want to lose my strength. However, I may have lost the ability to lift 100kg but I've gained so much more. Right now I FEEL the fittest I've ever felt.

I had no idea what I was going to do with my life when I returned. I had graduated uni as a speech therapist but knew deep down I didn't want to follow that path. Never did I imagine where I would be now, one year later. When I returned I threw myself full force into fitness - I made my website, I did my PT course and the most frightening thing, I packed my bags and moved to London. I've worked my socks off since I've been here and pushed myself way out of my comfort zone. It's been well and truly worth it as now I have my dream job working as a PT, fitness blogger, fitness model, co-founder of @thegirlgains and a few others bits and bobs (I like to say that I have my finger in many pies \ud83d\ude02). The thing that shocks me the most is that I wrote a letter to myself when I was in Asia. It outlined all my future goals and ambitions - many of which I thought would never happen. I opened it 6 months after I returned and I had ticked off about 80% of them.

Out in Bali smoothie bowls are big business. However, I only indulged in a couple on my travels there. This is simply because they tend to be laden with added (and natural) sugar. I don't tend to talk too much about sugar as I think it's totally ok in moderation. However, I think it's important to point out that if you started eating smoothie bowls for breakfast, lunch and dinner you could easily be packing in hundreds of grams of sugar a day without even realising it. One of the main issues with this is that this would be at the expense of the other valuable macronutrients protein and fats. As a result, I had a couple of smoothie bowls as treats but I tried to stick to meals which had a more balanced macro nutrient ratio including protein and healthy fats. Fruit heavy smoothies are great every once in a while but just be aware of your overall sugar intake across the day.

But for some reason I've been hesitant to delve into it on social media. I guess I've been concerned that you wouldn't be interested; because in the last I didn't care about it. If people spoke about meditation I would think \"nah, it's not for me\" and switch off. But over the course of the past few years it's slowly integrated into my routine. And now it's part of my daily life. I find that mindfulness (in various forms, not just mediation) not only helps me to destress, disconnect and gain perspective; but it's improves my mental clarity and also allows me to just be a better human. And I want to share that with you. So my question is this... Are you interested in mindfulness? What do you want to know? And what do you want me to share? Ultimately my goal is to help YOU. And the best way to do that is to know what you want.

What I loved most was the advice on how to implement change/fit in workouts, and healthy habits into your daily life. Zanna's personality jumps off the page making it an engaging, fun, and easy book to pick up and read. It is refreshing to have a book published that actually cares about its readers health and general wellbeing rather than trying to sell you some faddy diet or short term weightloss/fitness plan. This book is suitable for anyone looking to implement lasting and realistic changes and healthy habits into their life - which lets face, is the majority of us! \" - A very lovely Amazon review for my book Strong!

(But I have a sneaky suspicion is has something to do with my hormones, ladies you know the feels \ud83d\ude30). I woke up, went to the gym and did a few sets of pull ups. I wasn't feeling it so went home. Later on in the day I tried again and I did end up training, but I didn't feel strong. I didn't push myself. I just lifted my usual weights and didn't step out of my comfort zone. Plus, a few people said hey to me in the gym today. I consciously tried to be upbeat and talkative but I just wasn't in my usual positive mindset. Again, very unlike me. I felt kind of disappointed in myself. Why am I telling you this? Because we are all human. We can't always have the best workouts ever. Always be full of beans. Always be in a good mood. And you know what? We don't need to be. Half hearted workouts and half hearted days happen to the best of us. But what matters is that you move on from them and try again the next day.

I was brought up scuba diving, I started learning at the age of 12 and it's been a huge part of my life ever since. I remember diving in tropical waters in my teenage years and being surrounded by an abundance of soft corals, glowing brightly in the turquoise water. It mesmerised me \ud83d\ude0d I still LOVE diving and enjoy it thoroughly - the wildlife I've seen on this trip has been incredible \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc However I also find it upsetting the more I dive. In short: the oceans are dying. As every year passes, there is less coral and marine life. I see it every time I go down. And it honestly breaks my heart. I cry just thinking about it \ud83d\ude22 We have had huge global coral bleaching events the past two years and are predicted to have these every single year into the future, due to global warming, until it's all gone. Last year alone 30% of the Great Barrier Reef died. The largest living structure on earth, one of the seven wonders of the world. Gone. \ud83c\udf0e If we continue at this rate the most complex and diverse ecosystem on our planet is going to be obliterated in a matter of years. My children won't get to see and experience the wonders of the marine world which I have, and that saddens me deeply \ud83d\udc33 I am so desperately passionate about this and I don't want to lose hope. Please look into the issues affecting the ocean. Namely plastic pollution, global warming and over fishing \ud83d\udc19 We live on this earth for free. Looking after the planet is like paying our rent. Let's take responsibility for our actions so future generations can enjoy the beauty of our home.

Taking a step back was scary, as silly as that sounds \ud83d\ude48 But it was exactly what I needed and I'm so SO glad I did it. Not only was I truly able to enjoy my holiday, this beautiful island and quality time with my friends. But I was able to give myself some real headspace. Time to think. To absorb. To reflect. And I'm coming back feeling not only more motivated, but more grateful than ever before.

Enter the staggered stance \ud83d\udc81\ud83c\udffc This variation allows you to target the posterior chain on the front leg while maintaining a smooth hip hinge with minimal hip rotation. This means you can often go heavier as instead of focusing on not falling over, you can focus on strength, form and activation of the correct muscles \ud83e\udd17 Single leg RDLs are an amazing exercise for your posterior chain (which includes everyone's favourites, the hamstrings and glutes \ud83c\udf51) as well as for your core. If you're new to them then definitely try this variation to ease yourself into it. Also, if you've been lifting for ages, this is still a challenging exercise as it is a different movement pattern to what your body is used to; plus you can go heavier!

Here's mine. I've experienced unhappiness in the past. I've had tough times at school and university. I remember lying awake at night analysing my behaviour. Wondering why everyone excluded me and what was wrong with me. I was drowning myself in self-doubt. I told myself I would be happy when I was liked or when I was popular. That never worked out. When did I actually find happiness? When I truly and unapologetically accepted myself. And when I accepted that not everyone is going to like me. I had attached so much of my happiness to other people's opinions. But once I took it into my own hands, acknowledged my own worth, and started to value myself. That's when my mindset completely changed. I realised that you can't control what others think of you, but you can choose how you think about yourself. I chose to think positively and I never looked back \ud83d\ude0a Photo: @jonpaynephoto \ud83d\udc95 ", "tags": ["#girlgains", "#strongsquad", "#strongzvd"]}, {"date": "2016-11-02T18:12:17.000Z", "likes": 1488, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/5fcc2750eebbae038f35b02126fdd8be/5B5BC9EB/t51.2885-15/e35/14677204_996535990476144_1101778825047441408_n.jpg", "comments": 25, "description": "EXCLUSIVE SNEAK PEAK! \ud83d\ude48 Here is a sneak peak of the design and layout of my upcoming book: STRONG.

It lead to a cycle of weight loss followed by weight gain as I couldn't stick to my meal plans. They were boring, unenjoyable and restrictive. The real lasting progress was made once I stopped with the bullshit diets and focused on HEALTH! I switched low calorie weight watchers meals and processed \"light\" snack bars for good old meat, veggies and complex carbs. I fuelled my body with nutrient dense whole foods and stopped cutting out everything and anything. I finally managed to consistently stick to a balanced lifestyle and I had the energy to smash my workouts. As a result my body transformed in front of my eyes from \"skinny fat\" to strong and fit. And the best part of all? I was enjoying the journey and I still do years later. Sure I've learnt even more since then but I've managed to maintain a balanced approach to fitness and nutrition because I've ditched the fad diets and adopted lasting changes I can stick with for life. I promise you that being \"healthy\" doesn't make you feel tired and deprived. A balanced lifestyle energises you and allows you to eat nutrient dense foods in abundance!

It's a way to keep our hearts and minds and bodies healthy and happy.

My career! \ud83c\udf93 I graduated two years ago today. I studied Speech Science at the University of Sheffield and came out with a first, I was over the moon! Yet here I am two years later, working in the fitness industry. I turned my back on what I had studied for years to become. I remember being terrified of disappointing my parents who wanted me to do a \"proper job\", a category fitness blogging didn't quite fit into \ud83d\ude44 Instead of pursuing a career I didn't love, I took a gap year and told myself I had 12 months to make it happen. Giving myself that pressure made me work my little socks off. I trained as a PT and lived in an Air BnB on the outskirts of London until I found a flat share. I started personal training at @thelomaxway and built up a client base, all while developing my blog alongside it. My parents didn't quite get it and assumed I was just doing this for the summer, not for life. I remember the day I told them I was going to stick with it, they weren't sure it was the right move so I set out to prove to them it was! Now, two years after graduating, I LOVE my job and I think my parents are proud of me (at least I hope so!). I'm not saying everyone should abandon their degree after years of study, but I think it goes to show that it's ok to go against what is expected of you and you CAN achieve your goals when you work hard and never give up! \ud83d\udc95 ", "tags": ["#girlgains"]}, {"date": "2016-11-15T08:51:46.000Z", "likes": 28231, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/a95b114e8ca2ff98990d4dbc55c2de2d/5ADC5370/t51.2885-15/e15/15034676_367480110260977_8835729604640505856_n.jpg", "comments": 25, "description": "Press Play \u25b6\ufe0f Here is a sneak peak of my weekend in Jersey!

It can encompass your whole lifestyle. Right now it seems like everyone is working damn hard. People take pride in slogging away at their laptop at all hours of the day. It is admired to get hardly any sleep or work seven days a week. And if you don't work this hard? You're made to feel guilty. And you know what, I'm not about that life anymore. I've been there. I've done that. I've worked myself to burn out. I've had sleepless nights spent at my laptop. I've worked for weeks and weeks without a day off. It isn't fun and it isn't healthy. I'm a natural workaholic, I will drown myself in work if I can. But now, I still grind. I grind hard. But I pride myself on finally finding a work life balance. On finally giving myself time to relax. On finally being able to switch off from it all. And I don't feel guilty about it. So please don't make the mistakes I have in the past. Manage your stress levels. Take time out. Switch off. Disconnect. Look after yourself and look after your health\ud83d\ude18 I talk about this at length in my book Strong, available to preorder at bit.ly/strongzvd \ud83d\udc95", "tags": []}, {"date": "2017-10-11T17:50:47.000Z", "likes": 5079, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/e9d81f307321b0f4fc3fb5e1537201fc/5B5BF8FD/t51.2885-15/e35/22427562_484795535236409_4222541889552777216_n.jpg", "comments": 25, "description": "Back in the UK and back on it \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffc Today has been (and still is continuing to be!) one hell of a day!

Push the mixture into the bottom of the cake tin to form the crust. Now for the filling. Pop in a food processor: 1 cup pecans, 1 tub (170g) cashew butter, 200g dates and 3/4 cup unsweetened almond milk. Blend blend blend until it forms a smooth thick creamy paste. Pour this over the base and level it out. Finish the pie off by decorating the top with some more pecans. Pop it in the fridge to set for 1 hour, then take it out and remove it from the tin before you devour it!

I was completely addicted - read the entire book from cover to cover in one sitting and I know I will go back to it countless times when I need advice! It feels like Zanna is in the room with you, chatting to you like a best friend and personal trainer. This book isn't offering a quick fix or a cold turkey detox but a realistic, sustainable balanced approach to developing a healthy lifestyle.

I find that people get so caught up in the little things like what time they train or the frequency of their meals, when in reality these don't matter for 90% of people. What matters is that you train on a regular basis, enjoy yourself and push yourself in your workouts. What matters is that it fits into your schedule, whether that's early in the morning or late at night is irrelevant. In terms of diet - focus on eating wholesome single-ingredient foods as much as you can and getting in enough protein to support your training. There's no need to obsess about how many meals you have or whether you should eat asparagus or broccoli for dinner. What really matters is that you're fuelling your body and making consistent healthy choices. There's no magic secret to getting healthy. Detox teas and juice cleanses are bullshit. It's about making sustainable changes over time and making these into habits.

I'm sorry, what?! Guys these are the comments that worry me! There are so many distorted perceptions of what healthy is. I consider myself to be a healthy person. I eat carbs multiple times a day, including the evening. I eat gluten. I eat dairy. I eat bread. I eat chocolate. I eat doughnuts. I'm partial to a cheeky cocktail. I don't always drink 2 litres of water. I don't eat a ridiculous amount of protein. I'm not a big fan of salads. I don't weigh and measure every gram of food that passes my lips. I go out to eat multiple times a week. Sometimes I eat too much and sometimes I eat too little. I don't train everyday. My workouts are short and sweet. I don't do hours of cardio. I lift weights. All in all, I have a balanced approach to food, fitness and LIFE! I love my body and I look after it by training hard and nourishing it with wholesome foods 80% of the time. However I will never deprive myself of enjoying a social meal with my bestie or sharing a tub of ice cream with my boyfriend.

My initial reaction was YES. What an opportunity. I should totally take it! \ud83c\udf89 However I then sat down and really thought about it. My heart said yes, but my head said no. Endurance sport is amazing and I hugely admire those who run marathons. I do want to run one some day. But it's not something to be taken lightly. Often people throw themselves into marathons without really thinking about it. In reality it's a huge deal. You NEED to be savvy. See a physio before you start training. Get a gait analysis. Work around any imbalances. Get regular check ups as you go along. Have a coach and a proper training program. And dedicate hours every week to your runs \ud83d\udca6 It's a huge commitment, and with my absolutely manic schedule over the coming months I just don't think I would be able to do it safely. If I'm going to do a marathon, I'm going to do it right. And this year I cant do that. My body, performance and health are too precious to me to risk it \ud83d\ude05 So the takeaway message is this: endurance sport is INCREDIBLE but please think long and hard before throwing yourself in at the deep end. You need to be able to commit to it wholeheartedly to avoid injury and to enjoy the journey. And if you do take part? Do it safely \ud83d\udc97 If you're into endurance sports then follow @twicethehealth who take on huge challenges and train wisely\u270c\ud83c\udffc Wearing @adidasuk shot by @hugopettit \ud83d\udcf8 ", "tags": ["#londonmarathon", "#girlgains"]}, {"date": "2017-08-18T12:41:22.000Z", "likes": 2926, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/3d9625f6f0b76125e2225c5dfde295d7/5B57E268/t51.2885-15/e35/20838593_474550516258392_1964673231243706368_n.jpg", "comments": 25, "description": "Throwback to last nights dinner \ud83d\ude0b I cooked up a storm for @stephclairesmith: courgetti with falafel \"meatballs\" in a smoked aubergine and roasted mushroom sauce \ud83d\ude0d Delicious plant powered goodness \ud83c\udf31\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc I'm currently on my way to explore the Isle of Wight with @visitengland; be sure to follow my adventure with @healthychefsteph on my Instagram story! \ud83d\udc97 ", "tags": ["#girlgains", "#girlgainers", "#strongsquad", "#strongzvd"]}, {"date": "2015-05-10T12:24:53.000Z", "likes": 943, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/6d7f5a43168157084aa5eafab36da9eb/5B68F922/t51.2885-15/e15/11240746_1450614768566513_1268388082_n.jpg", "comments": 6, "description": "An epic salad inspired by the delicious food made by @allyscottbeattie at @balearicbootcampibiza \u2600\ufe0f I'm trying to up my salad game and this was my best attempt: @proteinpouch chicken, red onion, red peppers, spinach, watercress, rocket, sweet potato, carrot, beetroot, cucumber and feta!

I have a flexible fitness routine combining body weight training, weights and running. No macros. No calorie counting. No weighing myself or my meals. I eat plant based whole foods and I\u2019m basically a human carb \ud83c\udf5e For me, the goal is long term health and happiness, so I focus on enjoying my training and nutrition. No extreme restrictions. Just conscious eating and regular movement. \ud83d\udc83\ud83c\udffc So what\u2019s the lesson? It\u2019s a journey. Embrace the highs and lows, as they shape who you are.

Do you eat gluten? What about pasta and bread?\" YES! I eat everything. For me what works is a balanced diet where I allow myself all foods in moderation. I personally run best on fairly high carbohydrates so a large portion of my daily food intake comes from rice, sweet potato, fruit etc. I have a high protein intake and moderate fat intake. I also don't respond badly to gluten, pasta or bread so I will eat these on occasion. I am not intolerant to them so I don't need to cut them out. However obviously they are processed so I try to choose whole food carbohydrates first. (However, I do eat chocolate almost every day \ud83d\ude4a). These food choices are what works for ME! Please don't look at what I do and think that is the right way or only way to eat. It is just my way. I don't recommend my clients eat the same as me, I tailor my advice to their goals, preferences, training regimes, etc. There is no one diet plan that will give everyone results.

Why are you posting videos of handstands? Why? Let me tell you. To me, it's about challenging yourself. It is so easy to get comfortable. Especially with your training. You get into a routine. You enjoy it. You don't switch it up. Then you stagnate. I strongly believe that great things never come from comfort zones. It's important to learn to be comfortable with being uncomfortable. I have taken up gymnastics with @mikeleept because it's not something I'm naturally good at. I'm tall. I'm lanky. I'm uncoordinated. Gymnastics and me, we are certainly not a match made in heaven. And that's exactly why I'm pushing myself to do it. Because it's damn hard. It's teaching me so much about myself and my body. And I love that \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc Guys, fitness doesn't have to be going to the gym and lifting weights. Heading outside for a run. Taking a yoga class.

Chop up the apples into bite size pieces. Put the apples in a bowl with the spices and raisins, stir until the apple is coated in spices. Heat up a non stick pan on a medium/high and pop in the apple/spice/raisin mix and add in 1/4 cup water. Simmer until the apples are softened - you might need to add more water depending on how long it takes. Once the apples are softened place them in the bottom of your crumble tray. \ud83d\udc4d For the crumble layer you need:1 cup whole rolled oats, 1/2 cup almond flour, 1/4 cup powdered stevia, 1/3 cup toasted almond flakes, 1/4 cup dessicated coconut, 1/2 tsp cinnamon.

There has been a lot of discussion in the news, with many saying that it isn't reality and it can be a negative influence. My personal opinion is that social media is what you make it. If you spend your time scrolling through pictures of perfect girls with their perfect lives and compare yourselves to them - then it probably won't make you feel very good. It is so important to take everything you see online with a hefty pinch of salt. There is so much more that you don't see. You are only shown edited, filtered images of the highlights of people's lives. I am aware of the influence of my posts and I do try to be open and honest with you guys. Sure I will share aesthetically pleasing pictures but I also try to show the low points and not so glamorous parts of my life. In reality I am just the same as you. I have days where I don't have the motivation to train, days where I eat completely off plan, I have cellulite, I have bags under my eyes, I bite my nails, I cry. I often get told I have \"the perfect life\". Let me assure you that I don't, sure I have some amazing opportunities but remember... you just see the good bits. However - I think that if used correctly social media can be hugely positive. It can provide motivation to make positive changes, it can connect you with new people all over the world, allow you to share your passions and even lead to incredible friendships.

This is particularly challenging as my job relies on social media use.

Here's some things I have been doing: 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Turning my phone on airplane mode when I'm with someone. This allows me to give them my full attention and shows my respect for them. Nothing is worse than trying to talk to someone and they are constantly looking at their phone. 2\ufe0f\u20e3 I enjoy moments without capturing them. I look at a beautiful view without taking a picture, share a funny moment without tweeting about it or watch a concert without videoing it. It's nice to have memories that are just for me and whoever I'm with - rather than for social media. 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Looking up. When I'm out and about, especially when I'm walking around London or commuting, I make sure to avoid mindlessly scrolling on my phone. I take in my surroundings.

I've realised that I want my training and nutrition to focus less on aesthetics and more on function, strength, fitness and most of all - pleasure. I want to go on a 10km run if I fancy it and not worry about losing muscle. I want to lift heavy and get stronger, but I also want to do sprints and plyometric training. I want to fuel my body appropriately so I'm full of energy, and not worry about having abs. I don't want to feel like I have to conform to others ideas of what is the right and wrong way to train and eat. Don't get me wrong, I'm still going to lift because I absolutely love it and the changes it's made to my body. It is my favourite form of training!

Admittedly, my love for lifting weights has wavered over the past few years. I've had times when I loved it and times when I just wasn't feeling it. Times when I lifted 5 days a week and times when I lifted once a week. And I just want to say... that's ok. Fitness is for LIFE. You can't be expected the train the same way forever. Quite frankly, that would be boring! That's why I always love to mix it up. I do classes. I do gymnastics. I do boxing. I run. I lift. I'm up for trying anything! I dabble and I'm not ashamed of that. I think sometimes you see the girls on Instagram all lifting weights and you think that's what you HAVE to do. If you love it, go for it. And if you don't, don't force yourself.

I cannot tell you what weight to lift! I don't know you. I don't know your training history. I haven't seen you move. Without this information (and more) I can't prescribe a weight. Which is why I never share weights on my posts. What works for me may not work for you, and vice versa \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffc What you need to do, is pick a weight which challenges YOU in the rep range you're working in. For example if it's squats for 3 sets of 10 reps. You need to find a weight which leaves you really struggling to complete the last few reps, but able to maintain good form throughout \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc For some that may be bodyweight for some that may be with 100kg on your back! \ud83d\ude1d The main thing to remember is to PUSH yourself! Don't pick a weight you know you can comfortably lift. It needs to be uncomfortable, as that's where change happens and strength develops. Similarly, try not to use the same weight over and over for months on end. Focus on upping those weights and reps over time. I have a full blog post on my website on this principle of \"progressive overload\" so check it out if you're confused \ud83e\udd13 And finally - please don't compare your weights on day one to someone else's weights on day 300 of their journey. It takes time to build up strength and every expert started as a beginner.

I lived off a diet of pizza and vodka. By the end of second year I had become \"skinny fat\". I had gained a stone but I was slim and untoned. I then used various fad diets such as low carb, low fat and low calorie approaches to get myself looking like the photo on the left. I was 62kg and unfit. I couldn't run for the bus without panting. Thankfully I soon became tired of being tired. Of yoyo diets. Of hating exercise. I made an Instagram account and I decided I wanted to try lifting weights like the girls I followed. This began a 5 year journey to where I am now in the right hand photo. I'm 72kg - yes 10 kilos heavier - and I'm fitter, healthier and happier than ever before. It was a slow process of self education. I went through phases of bodybuilding, IIFYM, paleo... everything! You name it, I tried it. There was A LOT of trial and error. But a couple of years ago I reached a point where I finally achieved my own personal balance. I don't fit into a box or a label. I train flexibly, in ways I enjoy. I lift weights. I do cardio. I play around with headstands. I like to try new classes, box and do crossfit on occasion. I train to get fitter and stronger, not to look a certain way. I eat mostly plant based and completely intuitively. I listen to my body and nourish it with good quality wholesome food. I don't put pressure on myself to train or eat a certain way. And most importantly? I've gone from regularly criticising my body to loving myself unapologetically. That is the biggest progress of all. Now, I am full of endless motivation to train hard and eat well because I love myself!

So, I got a temporary room and intended to be here for 6 weeks... I never left! London grabbed me with both hands and sucked me in. I started working as a PT, got signed to @w_modelmgmt and worked on my blog. It was a big risk and a stark contrast from living on a farm in Yorkshire. I didn't know where this was going to take me but I worked my arse off. Soon enough opportunities came knocking. As things developed, I went from 7 days a week PT down to 5 and now down to 2. I currently have two companies and my own activewear collection releasing soon. I am the co-founder of @thegirlgains. I speak. I write. I film. I do shoots. I train people. I never imagined this time last year when I moved to this city that my life would change this much. My masters degree has been put on hold and I'm quite literally chasing my dreams. I have no idea where this will take me and I'm not naive...

We are all guilty of comparing ourselves to others. You might think \"why aren't I as fit as her?\" but that girl has probably been working hard to get fit for months or even years. Maintaining a lean physique or getting into amazing shape takes graft, graft that people often don't show or share. If you're struggling, don't forget that the people you're following have their struggles to. They just might not show them. Please remember that we all started somewhere. The people you follow on Instagram we're not born with bulging biceps or a rippling six pack. Every master was once a novice. Progress takes time, it can be slow and frustrating. Half the battle is sticking with it when you feel disheartened. But your journey is unique to you - if you're following someone who seems to be going from strength to strength then be happy for them. Be inspired. But don't compare yourself. You will have your moment, you will reach your goals. You just need to believe in yourself, work towards your goals and wait until you reach your chapter 20. \ud83d\udc95 ", "tags": ["#girlgains"]}, {"date": "2014-02-04T10:13:06.000Z", "likes": 254, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/c1b4fc95cf1f33bd87dbb0fc28b7d849/5B5B898D/t51.2885-15/e15/1799854_585396244885433_304135143_n.jpg", "comments": 5, "description": "\ud83c\udf1f Banana Chocolate Protein Bars \ud83c\udf1f You need: 1 scoop chocolate protein powder, 2 scoops banana protein powder, 170g Greek yoghurt, 2 eggs, 1/2 cup flour (I used oat flour), 1/4 cup cocoa powder, 1/4 cup honey and a handful of chocolate chips.

I get asked this all the time, and I used to struggle to give a clear cut answer. Knowing your values takes time, life experience and self-reflection. I have grown to realise that what really matters to me is strength, positivity and happiness. I want the strength to take on life, face new challenges, overcome setbacks and push myself to achieve my dreams. I choose positivity. I consciously stay positive, avoid negative vibes and try to find the good in every day. And of course, happiness. Isn't this everyone\u2019s ultimate goal? I believe that if you choose to be present in the moment and to be positive, grateful and mindful it is so much easier to find your version of happiness. These are the three principles I strive to keep in the forefront of my mind on a daily basis. As you can tell, I am passionate about my values. Which is why I am so excited to be teaming up with @theofficialpandora and their ESSENCE collection. The collection is based around charms which represent your personal journey of self-improvement and your key values. I chose the Strength, Positivity and Happiness charms. I will be working with @theofficialpandora over the next few weeks to share my values more deeply with you, so keep your eyes peeled \ud83d\udc95 ", "tags": ["#strongzvd", "#DOMotivate", "#DOPANDORA", "#Ad"]}, {"date": "2016-11-13T08:39:23.000Z", "likes": 2417, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/ebefddba694afae8c4830c755106eb3a/5B6177A1/t51.2885-15/e35/14504784_197606357358153_3258281943023747072_n.jpg", "comments": 25, "description": "No flex vs flexing \ud83d\ude1d I've been told online on numerous occasions that I don't look \"strong\" or that my body hasn't changed.

I look at the girls running marathons and think \"they're so fit!\" while I struggle to complete a 5km. I'm the same as you, I do it, we all do. However, if there's one thing I've learnt in the past few years of being a blogger; its that this isn't our whole life. It's a snapshot. You don't know what goes on behind the scenes. We snapchat the best bits, the highlights of our day. We Instagram photos which are filtered within an inch of their lives. We focus on the fun stuff, not the graft; and we work damn hard behind the scenes. In reality, we all have good and bad days. We all cry sometimes. We all have our insecurities. And quite frankly, we all have our own shit to deal with \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc So next time you find yourself comparing yourself to someone on social media, remember that we are all human \ud83d\ude18 Photo: @jonpaynephoto \ud83d\udc95", "tags": []}, {"date": "2014-08-10T17:33:37.000Z", "likes": 437, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/a4df156b105a402c08c71e968cca9984/5ADB690C/t51.2885-15/e15/10570141_648380371936508_590683655_n.jpg", "comments": 25, "description": "A few clips from today's epic session with @be_x_fit \ud83d\udcaa This girl is an absolute babe - go and check her out \ud83d\ude18 We trained shoulders and back and then finished off with some HIIT.\nHere you can see:\n\u27a1\ufe0f Double and single arm battle ropes\n\u27a1\ufe0f TRX squat jumps (my current favourite because you can jump so high!)\n\u27a1\ufe0f Kettlebell swings\n\u27a1\ufe0f Alternating step ups/jumps\n\u27a1\ufe0f Explosive jumping jacks\n\u27a1\ufe0f We also did box jumps, ladder work, 100m sprints and mountain climbers.\nMy leggings are from @posto9activa if you're wondering!\nTry adding some of these moves into your workouts and let me know how you get on!

Since I broke my hand I've been really struggling with motivation. I feel disheartened as I can't train the way I want to or lift as heavy as I would like. I can't deadlift, do chin ups, or go to @f45londonbridge; my favourite things! Plus I'm so busy at the moment that I often feel too stressed to train. It keeps dropping to the bottom of my priority list. Basically... I haven't been doing very well with the fitness side of things. However, after a pep talk from my coach @lbp_adamwillis I'm feeling much more positive. Ultimately it's all about mindset. I have to choose to focus on what I CAN do rather than what I can't. Set myself new fitness goals, to keep myself motivated. And work around the limitations of my hand. I refuse to let this injury get in the way of my training! \ud83d\ude1d\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc Outfit: @2xu_uk @labelonline @adidasuk @activeinstyle \ud83d\udc95 ", "tags": ["#girlgains", "#strongzvd", "#zvdstrongchallenge"]}, {"date": "2015-08-24T12:22:30.000Z", "likes": 1013, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/b0283507bda100119559f047d64bd6e6/5B591B2B/t51.2885-15/e35/11809971_810673989045263_344184521_n.jpg", "comments": 25, "description": "Lunch: Turkey mince fried in coconut oil with Cajun spices, mixed veggies and some spicy rice - yum! \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb Also - check out the Mail Online today for an interview with me about how to stay healthy at uni!
