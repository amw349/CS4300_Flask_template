Spread a little cookie dough along the length of each piece. Starting with the opposite side, roll the dough up into a log, enclosing the toppings inside. Pinch the seams together and then very gently roll the dough with your hands to form an even cylinder and fully enclose the filling.\nTake the two ends of each rope and form into a circle that is overlapped by a couple of inches of dough on either side, twist the ends and lay over the opposite side to form a pretzel shape. Press the ends under the pretzel to seal.\nGrab a bowl and fill it with warm water and 2 teaspoons baking soda. Dunk each pretzel in water and then place on a parchment lined baking sheet. Brush the tops with the egg wash and season liberally with sea salt. Bake at 425 for 15 to 18 minutes or until pretzels are very lightly golden and the cookies that have oozed out are golden. You do not want to over cook the pretzels. Eat warm...with milk.
