With that being said, league officials are likely to focus on his mental outlook once he entered free agency in March of 2017 and whether he corrupted his free-agent market through a series of factors relating to football skills, contract expectations and motivation to play.\n\nSome of the inquiries that are expected to be on the agenda for NFL lawyers, include: -Whether Kaepernick expected to be signed as a starter once he opted out of his contract with the San Francisco 49ers. -What salary demands he or his representation had in mind early in free agency. -Whether Kaepernick\u2019s capacity to play diminished due to past injuries. -How Kaepernick related to coaches or teammates while playing for the 49ers. -Whether Kaepernick expressed a willingness to continue his professional football career anywhere outside of the NFL. -Whether Kaepernick has ever discovered or been presented with tangible proof that NFL teams or executives sought to eliminate him from playing in the league again.\n\nA source familiar with the proceedings says that while this is a significant peak in the collusion case, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean an end is near and it\u2019s realistic that this could drag well into 2019.\n\nKaepernick, 30, visited with the Seattle Seahawks last year, but left without a contract agreement. Since then, there hasn\u2019t been any reported interest in him.\n\nIn 2016, Kaepernick completed 59.2 percent of his passes for 2,241 yards and 16 touchdowns and four interceptions for the 49ers. He also rushed for 468 yards.\nStay tuned for more.\n\n________________________________________________________\n"}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/35e60dc18f7556e99f959a02848eb46b/5B7E6C71/t51.2885-15/e35/30087744_850827735101631_6925928390239191040_n.jpg", "tags": ["#nfl", "#nflnews", "#nfllive", "#nflupdates", "#nflnow", "#espn", "#espnnews", "#espnupdates", "#espnnow", "#sports", "#sportsnation", "#sportsupdates", "#sportscenter", "#football", "#footballlive", "#footballnews", "#footballupdates", "#footballnews", "#rumor", "#updates", "#sportsnews", "#fantasyfootball", "#yahoosports", "#espnfantasyfootball", "#nflfreeagency", "#johntimu", "#chicagobears"], "comments": 11, "likes": 1242, "date": "2018-03-20T13:39:37.000Z", "description": "NFL News: According to reports, the Chicago Bears announced they re-signed LB John Timu.\nTimu, 25, appeared in 11 games this past season (2 starts) and recorded 13 total tackles and one pass defense.\n________________________________________________________\n"}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/285dbb49fd4f15e7098b315f88567010/5B5CD461/t51.2885-15/e35/30079604_428634387560382_8009914398434918400_n.jpg", "tags": ["#nfl", "#nflnews", "#nfllive", "#nflupdates", "#nflnow", "#espn", "#espnnews", "#espnupdates", "#espnnow", "#sports", "#sportsnation", "#sportsupdates", "#sportscenter", "#football", "#footballlive", "#footballnews", "#footballupdates", "#footballnews", "#rumor", "#rumors", "#updates", "#sportsnews", "#fantasyfootball", "#yahoosports", "#espnfantasyfootball", "#briancushing", "#houstontexans", "#freeagency"], "comments": 25, "likes": 1838, "date": "2018-02-20T17:14:12.000Z", "description": "UPDATE: According to reports, the Houston Texans officially released LB Brian Cushing.\nThe Texans picked up $7.64M of cap space by releasing Cushing.\nCushing, 31, started five games this season and recorded 16 total tackles and 1.5 sacks.\n________________________________________________________\n"}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/68d242d6b8fc915ab71021695eba5b63/5B96C6AA/t51.2885-15/e35/29738534_788350988028239_4112430369876213760_n.jpg", "tags": ["#nfl", "#nflnews", "#nfllive", "#nflupdates", "#nflnow", "#espn", "#espnnews", "#espnupdates", "#espnnow", "#sports", "#sportsnation", "#sportsupdates", "#sportscenter", "#football", "#footballlive", "#footballnews", "#footballupdates", "#footballnews", "#rumor", "#updates", "#sportsnews", "#fantasyfootball", "#yahoosports", "#espnfantasyfootball", "#nfldraft", "#newyorkjets", "#robbyanderson"], "comments": 25, "likes": 3413, "date": "2018-04-03T19:05:25.000Z", "description": "UPDATE: The Broward County State Attorney\u2019s Office announced that eight of the nine charges against Jets WR Robby Anderson have been dropped.\nThese charges are stemming from Anderson\u2019s January arrest for allegedly driving 105 mph in a 45 mph zone in Florida.

This was due in large part to the Seahawks\u2019 asking price of first and third-round picks.\nHowever, there is growing belief that both sides will re-open dialogue during the upcoming draft. The Seahawks have been non-committal about retaining Thomas for the 2018 season, despite the All-Pro safety expressing his desire to retire with the organization on social media last month.\nSeahawks GM John Schneider along with other teams know that their lofty asking price is not reasonable, considering Thomas\u2019 expiring contract. The Cowboys are well aware of the Seahawks\u2019 interest to acquire a second or third-round pick, simply because they don\u2019t have either at this point in time. After Seattle picks at 18th overall, they will not have another selection until the fourth-round. With that being said, Dallas is expected to offer the Seahawks their second-round pick (No. 50 overall) for Thomas.\nMany league executives believe the the Seahawks will eventually accept Dallas\u2019 offer, which will end Thomas\u2019 eight year run in Seattle.\nIn addition, the Cowboys\u2019 decision to take $8.5M of cap space from Dez Bryant\u2019s release is another indicative factor that they are indeed keeping flexibility to fit Thomas under their payroll for the upcoming season. Dallas could have designated Bryant as a Post-June 1 release, which would have freed up $12.5M against the cap, but their decision to take the immediate cap space provides another clue that this rumor does indeed have validity.\nIt\u2019s also worth mentioning that a trade will be contingent upon Seattle giving Dallas permission to speak with Thomas\u2019 agent to discuss terms of a potential contract extension.\nThomas, 28, is entering the final year of his 4-year/$40M deal and stands to make a base salary of $8.5M for the 2018 season.\nStay tuned for more.\n\n________________________________________________________\n"}, {"img":

will consider all options.\nThe New York Jets made an aggressive trade to acquire the No. 3 overall pick from the Indianapolis Colts on Saturday, but it came at a heavy cost.\nThe Jets parted ways with their No. 6 overall pick, two 2018 second-round picks (No. 37 + 49) to go along with a 2019 second-round pick.\nWith that being said, the Bills have been rumored to have interest in moving up for their franchise quarterback, especially considering their recent trade with the Cincinnati Bengals that netted them the 12th overall pick. In addition, the Bills possess the 22nd overall pick to go along with a total of five picks in the top-65, so they do have the draft capital to make a competitive offer to the Cleveland Browns or New York Giants for a top-2 pick.\nHowever, while the Bills may explore the idea of a trade-up scenario, Beane is not ready to commit to it at this time. \"The truth? Most of these quarterbacks I've only spent 15 minutes with. [At the combine, each team can meet with prospects for a maximum of 15 minutes per player.] I haven't spent enough time to have an opinion about any of them yet, honestly. I actually sent a little note to our [scouts] yesterday. We got six weeks to get our board together. I am not there yet, knowing if we can or will move up again. I want [head coach] Sean [McDermott] to get to know all of them. We're just keeping an open mind. Where we're at, we've got the picks, we've got the draft capital. I'm not ready to pull the trigger.\" The Bills acquired a 2018 third-round pick from the Cleveland Browns in exchange for Tyrod Taylor and went on to sign A.J. McCarron to a 2-year/$10M contract last week.\nStay tuned for more. ________________________________________________________\n"}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/d60c090b663b39e5114c54fcda630c78/5B9D1C39/t51.2885-15/e35/29738848_555744084807892_3584176669805510656_n.jpg", "tags": ["#nfl", "#nflnews", "#nfllive", "#nflupdates", "#nflnow", "#espn", "#espnnews", "#espnupdates", "#espnnow", "#sports", "#sportsnation", "#sportsupdates", "#sportscenter", "#football", "#footballlive", "#footballnews", "#footballupdates", "#footballnews", "#rumor", "#rumors", "#updates", "#sportsnews", "#fantasyfootball", "#yahoosports", "#espnfantasyfootball", "#miamidolphins", "#ryantannehill"], "comments": 25, "likes": 2135, "date": "2018-02-14T19:52:23.000Z", "description": "Injury Update: According to reports, Dolphins QB Ryan Tannehill (Knee) is expected to be cleared for the start of OTA\u2019s.\nTannehill re-injured his partially torn ACL back in Training Camp and it led the Dolphins to place him on season-ending Injured Reserve for the entire 2017 season.\nTannehill was coming off a 2016 season where he threw for 2,995 yards, 19 touchdowns and 12 interceptions to go along with a 67.1 completion percentage in 13 starts.\nTannehill, 29, is set to enter the second-year of his 4-year/$77M contract and stands to make a base salary of $17.475M for the 2018 season.\n________________________________________________________\n"}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/2b2913044f4b69d9bf024df71dfacdec/5B6A5F2F/t51.2885-15/e35/29737149_1801750866793911_9105807808321814528_n.jpg", "tags": ["#nfl", "#nflnews", "#nfllive", "#nflupdates", "#nflnow", "#espn", "#espnnews", "#espnupdates", "#espnnow", "#sports", "#sportsnation", "#sportsupdates", "#sportscenter", "#football", "#footballlive", "#footballnews", "#footballupdates", "#footballnews", "#rumor", "#rumors", "#updates", "#sportsnews", "#fantasyfootball", "#yahoosports", "#espnfantasyfootball", "#detroitlions", "#richardsherman", "#nflfreeagency"], "comments": 25, "likes": 4279, "date": "2018-03-10T19:57:07.000Z", "description": "UPDATE: According to reports, the Detroit Lions are scheduled to host Former Seahawks CB Richard Sherman for a visit next week.\nSherman concluded his meeting with the San Francisco 49ers without signing a deal.\nStay tuned for more.\n________________________________________________________\n"}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/ac9ca770de952f4354a9204c19578ed2/5B960A20/t51.2885-15/e35/29738319_155704901792802_2608277409148960768_n.jpg", "tags": ["#nfl", "#nflnews", "#nfllive", "#nflupdates", "#nflnow", "#espn", "#espnnews", "#espnupdates", "#espnnow", "#sports", "#sportsnation", "#sportsupdates", "#sportscenter", "#football", "#footballlive", "#footballnews", "#footballupdates", "#footballnews", "#rumor", "#rumors", "#updates", "#sportsnews", "#fantasyfootball", "#yahoosports", "#espnfantasyfootball", "#philadelphiaeagles", "#leseanmccoy", "#buffalobills"], "comments": 25, "likes": 2778, "date": "2018-02-02T15:33:59.000Z", "description": "NFL News: According to reports, the Philadelphia Eagles attempted to trade for Bills RB LeSean McCoy before the 2017 season.\nEagles VP of Football Operations Howie Roseman reportedly offered the Bills a package of players headlined by WR Jordan Matthews for McCoy, but his proposal was rejected.

expressed interest in Mayfield early into the draft process.

Mayfield could be an intriguing fit in Adam Gase\u2019s spread offense.\nQuenton Nelson is regarded as the best player of this year\u2019s draft class and could go as high as 2nd overall to the Giants. In this particular mock draft, Nelson falls into the Bears\u2019 lap at No. 8 overall and it should be a no-brainer selection for Matt Nagy and co.\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that the 49ers and Raiders, who both finished with a 6-10 regular season record, will flip a coin at the combine this week to determine who will pick 9th and 10th overall.\n1.

I expect the Patriots to get off to a fast start against an inexperienced Philadelphia team. Look for New England to roll out many different looks offensively to keep the Eagles' explosive pass-rush off balance. I believe Rex Burkhead will be the x-factor in today's matchup. Burkhead has been productive when healthy this season and his silence in their offense the last couple weeks makes me believe that he will be heavily featured today. Look for a lot of running back screens and quick passes over the middle. Those sequence of play-calls will then open up the opportunity for the Patriots to find success with running back draw plays. I expect the Eagles' defense to be aggressive with their alignments against the Patriots' high-potent offense. Malcolm Jenkins will be called upon to defend Rob Gronkowski when he is split out wide, so keep an eye on that matchup and its implications.\nAs for Foles and the Eagles' offense, look to see a heavy dose of the run-pass options, which has been a staple to their successful postseason. However, I do expect Doug Pederson to dial up a plethora of new plays that will put the New England defense on their heels. I believe Jay Ajayi and LeGarrette Blount will combine for over 125 rush yards against a Patriots defense that struggles to defend inside runs. I think New England will do a nice job of limiting Zach Ertz's production, but this is where I look for Nelson Agholor to come away with some big plays out of the slot.\nI believe the Eagles will be playing from behind for most of the game and I expect them to close the gap in the fourth quarter as they slowly hit their stride. It will come down to the Eagles' defense having to stop Brady in the late stages of the game to give their offense a chance. However, Brady has seen it all at this stage of his career and I think he will find a way to make a game-clinching throw down the field to seal their sixth Super Bowl title. Pats win a tight one, 30-24."}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/96d1d4b586ac56d98c333596e7ece553/5B6313DF/t51.2885-15/e35/29738835_2046610358699637_8569460216611995648_n.jpg", "tags": ["#nfl", "#nflnews", "#nfllive", "#nflupdates", "#nflnow", "#espn", "#espnnews", "#espnupdates", "#espnnow", "#sports", "#sportsnation", "#sportsupdates", "#sportscenter", "#football", "#footballlive", "#footballnews", "#footballupdates", "#footballnews", "#rumor", "#updates", "#sportsnews", "#fantasyfootball", "#yahoosports", "#espnfantasyfootball", "#nflfreeagency", "#ndamukongsuh", "#oaklandraiders", "#seattleseahawks", "#dallascowboys"], "comments": 25, "likes": 3010, "date": "2018-03-14T21:26:57.000Z", "description": "NFL News: According to reports, the Oakland Raiders, Seattle Seahawks, and Dallas Cowboys have expressed interest in Former Dolphins DT Ndamukong Suh.\nStay tuned for more.\n________________________________________________________\n"}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/3d22bd0890fe088c4985f7060d412890/5B9392A4/t51.2885-15/e35/29737359_1788259811482621_5846581616738041856_n.jpg", "tags": ["#nfl", "#nflnews", "#nfllive", "#nflupdates", "#nflnow", "#espn", "#espnnews", "#espnupdates", "#espnnow", "#sports", "#sportsnation", "#sportsupdates", "#sportscenter", "#football", "#footballlive", "#footballnews", "#footballupdates", "#footballnews", "#rumor", "#rumors", "#updates", "#sportsnews", "#fantasyfootball", "#yahoosports", "#espnfantasyfootball", "#ezekielansah", "#detroitlions"], "comments": 25, "likes": 1981, "date": "2018-02-21T23:13:50.000Z", "description": "NFL News: According to reports, the Detroit Lions are likely to place the franchise tag on impending free-agent DE Ezekiel Ansah.\nThe window to designate the franchise/transition tag officially opened on Tuesday and all signs point toward the Lions placing the franchise tag on their best pass-rusher sometime before the March 6th deadline.\nThe Lions have not opened contract negotiations with Ansah as of yet, but they could look to do so in the near future.

Will Hernandez fits the bill and would be a nice addition to help keep Cam Newton up-right next season.\nLamar Jackson is one of the many wildcard prospects in this year\u2019s draft class and could easily be a top-15 pick.

This needs to be done to ensure the receiving team that they are not acquiring Cousins as a one-year rental. If he wanted to, Cousins could decide against negotiating a long-term deal with an interested team to delay the process of a deal or ultimately wipe away a potential trade from happening.\nAt this

The only thing left to find out is if he\u2019ll be playing elsewhere in 2018.\nThere is \u201cgrowing sense\u201d within the Cowboys\u2019 organization that Bryant will be released on Friday. Several team executives have reportedly been making a strong case for the Joneses to sever ties with the 3-time Pro-Bowl wideout. They argue that he\u2019s regressed physically and don\u2019t believe he can regain his dominant form due to recent injuries and his inability to create separation at the line of scrimmage.\nBryant is set to enter the fourth year of his 5-year/$70M contract ($45M guaranteed) and is due a base salary of $12.5M over the final two years of the agreement. Bryant is scheduled to carry a $16.5M cap hit for the upcoming season.\n\nIf the Cowboys do indeed release Bryant, they would free up $8.5M of cap space, while absorbing $8M of dead money. They can also designate him as a Post-June 1 release that would free up $12.5M of cap space, while splitting up his $8M of dead money over the 2018 and 2019 seasons ($4M each year).

Chicago went 1-3 with Glennon as their starter and that\u2019s what prompted a quarterback change with Trubisky getting the nod for the rest of the season.\nWith the Trubisky era in full swing in the Windy City entering the offseason, Glennon\u2019s one year stint appears to be all but over.\nGlennon, 28, is set to enter the second year of his 3-year deal and stands to make base salaries of $12.5M

Yeah, not many of us, if any. While it's baffling, to say the least, we can't take anything away from the two Texas natives that have battled their way through adversity to reach this point in their careers. It's what makes this matchup odd, yet entertaining.\nAs for the matchup, I do anticipate this game being a defensive battle. The Eagles have the 4th ranked defense and the Vikings boast the top-ranked defense, so there is a reason to believe that this one will come down to which unit can win the turnover battle. A slow offensive start cannot be in the cards for the Eagles today. It's easier said than done going up against Minnesota's elite unit, but if they put all the weight on their defense again, it won't bode well for their chances to advance. So I expect Doug Pederson to dial up a variety of calls that will work the middle of the field. Foles will be given plenty of RPO's early and often, but I do anticipate the Eagles using screenplays to help alleviate Minnesota's fierce pass-rush. As for the Vikings' offense, they'll look to establish their run game with Latavius Murray and Jerick McKinnon. The Eagles' secondary has drastically improved each week, but they are still susceptible to giving up big plays down the field. Minnesota has the personnel with Stefon Diggs and Adam Thielen to exploit that weakness, so I expect Keenum to connect on a long ball for six. I think Jake Elliott will be a busy man tonight, as the Eagles will rely on his kicking ability to keep them in the game. This game will be determined in the trenches and I think the Vikings' ability to run the ball consistently in the second half will help them control the clock and manage field position. In result, it will pin the Eagles' offense deep into their own territory on many occasions which will produce a costly turnover in the fourth quarter for Philly. Minnesota ices the game with a late score to make it 27-19 and that will secure them their first trip to the Super Bowl since 1977."}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/9c1e6d98b29b5846509a08c5476e14b6/5B5D4051/t51.2885-15/e35/29737302_185699192226910_6488342411859722240_n.jpg", "tags": ["#nfl", "#nflnews", "#nfllive", "#nflupdates", "#nflnow", "#espn", "#espnnews", "#espnupdates", "#espnnow", "#sports", "#sportsnation", "#sportsupdates", "#sportscenter", "#football", "#footballlive", "#footballnews", "#footballupdates", "#footballnews", "#rumor", "#rumors", "#updates", "#sportsnews", "#fantasyfootball", "#yahoosports", "#espnfantasyfootball", "#washingtonredskins", "#kevinbowen"], "comments": 5, "likes": 1742, "date": "2018-03-06T16:54:19.000Z", "description": "NFL News: According to reports, the Washington Redskins announced they waived OL Kevin Bowen.\nBowen, 24, went undrafted out of East Central back in 2016 and signed with the Redskins as a rookie free-agent.\n________________________________________________________\n"}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/f0c273f76cd9b7fdb0d5861717d84f0c/5B7FB8F5/t51.2885-15/e35/30077578_178590522695983_3972844349368041472_n.jpg", "tags": ["#nfl", "#nflnews", "#nfllive", "#nflupdates", "#nflnow", "#espn", "#espnnews", "#espnupdates", "#espnnow", "#sports", "#sportsnation", "#sportsupdates", "#sportscenter", "#football", "#footballlive", "#footballnews", "#footballupdates", "#footballnews", "#rumor", "#updates", "#sportsnews", "#fantasyfootball", "#yahoosports", "#espnfantasyfootball", "#nfldraft", "#brandondoughty", "#miamidolphins"], "comments": 25, "likes": 2304, "date": "2018-04-04T20:11:02.000Z", "description": "NFL News: According to reports, the Miami Dolphins waived QB Brandon Doughty.\n\nDoughty, 26, is a former 2016 seventh-round pick of the Dolphins and has spent time on their practice squad for the last two seasons.\nDoughty has yet to appear in a regular season game.\n________________________________________________________\n"}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/9e70ccbfa30f1669a649d94f320e968e/5B5E4AFD/t51.2885-15/e35/30076833_246484432562173_1607311284833878016_n.jpg", "tags": ["#nfl", "#nflnews", "#nfllive", "#nflupdates", "#nflnow", "#espn", "#espnnews", "#espnupdates", "#espnnow", "#sports", "#sportsnation", "#sportsupdates", "#sportscenter", "#football", "#footballlive", "#footballnews", "#footballupdates", "#footballnews", "#rumor", "#rumors", "#updates", "#sportsnews", "#fantasyfootball", "#yahoosports", "#espnfantasyfootball", "#neworleanssaints", "#muhammadwilkerson", "#nflfreeagency"], "comments": 25, "likes": 2526, "date": "2018-03-08T23:43:14.000Z", "description": "UPDATE: According to reports, the New Orleans Saints are scheduled to host Former Jets DL Muhammad Wilkerson for a visit in the coming days.\nWilkerson completed his meeting with the Green Bay Packers today.\nIn addition, Wilkerson has a scheduled visit lined up with the Kansas City Chiefs.\n________________________________________________________\n"}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/b0604f20bb4822802b958dbeed2f01e7/5B9BF816/t51.2885-15/e35/29737841_1795503370745310_2515751083310055424_n.jpg", "tags": ["#nfl", "#nflnews", "#nfllive", "#nflupdates", "#nflnow", "#espn", "#espnnews", "#espnupdates", "#espnnow", "#sports", "#sportsnation", "#sportsupdates", "#sportscenter", "#football", "#footballlive", "#footballnews", "#footballupdates", "#footballnews", "#rumor", "#rumors", "#updates", "#sportsnews", "#fantasyfootball", "#yahoosports", "#espnfantasyfootball", "#buffalobills"], "comments": 25, "likes": 2758, "date": "2018-02-27T00:20:52.000Z", "description": "NFL News: According to reports, the Buffalo Bills are signing former Colts CB Vontae Davis to a one-year deal.\nDavis, 29, spent the last six seasons with the Indianapolis Colts.\n________________________________________________________\n"}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/205686d421fd7be1af4306e286051f1d/5B7923B2/t51.2885-15/e35/30084730_2092887777623878_5575993956920983552_n.jpg", "tags": ["#nfl", "#nflnews", "#nfllive", "#nflupdates", "#nflnow", "#espn", "#espnnews", "#espnupdates", "#espnnow", "#sports", "#sportsnation", "#sportsupdates", "#sportscenter", "#football", "#footballlive", "#footballnews", "#footballupdates", "#footballnews", "#rumor", "#updates", "#sportsnews", "#fantasyfootball", "#yahoosports", "#espnfantasyfootball", "#nfldraft", "#tampabaybuccaneers", "#adamhumphries"], "comments": 11, "likes": 1579, "date": "2018-04-16T16:04:29.000Z", "description": "NFL News: According to reports, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers re-signed RFA WR Adam Humphries to a one-year deal.\nTampa Bay placed the second-round restricted tender on Humphries, which will cost them $2.914M for the 2018 season.\n\nHumphries, 24, appeared in all 16 games for the Buccaneers and caught 61 passes for 631 yards receiving and one touchdown.

However, Bell is still looking to be paid adequately and is seeking a deal worth $14.5M per year. Bell confirmed that he passed up the Steelers\u2019 offer last July that included $42M guaranteed over the first three years with an average of $13.3M over the life of the deal.\nBell also reiterated that he will consider retirement if he doesn\u2019t receive a long-term deal before the 2018 season. \"I just have to decide if I'm going to play when the time comes,\" Bell said.\n\nBell once again stated the importance of guaranteed money in his next contract and does not plan to settle for anything less than his value. \"I'm the one to bet on myself. And I'll do it again,\" Bell said. \"I understand how the Steelers do contracts. Last year, I was pounding the table on guaranteed money. That's not the case. If I'm not getting guaranteed money, I want a lot more up front. ... It's year-to-year with the Steelers. Essentially if I sign a four- or five-year deal, I'm playing four or five franchise tags.\u201d The highest paid running back in the NFL is Falcons RB Devonta Freeman, who is making an annual salary of $8.25M. Bell certainly hopes to earn almost double that salary to retire as a member of the Steelers.\nOnly time will tell if it can actually happen.\nBell started 15 regular season games and rushed for 1,291 yards on 321 carries (4.0 YPC) and nine touchdowns.

their system: \u201cIt\u2019s a little weird,\u201d Brown said of his former teammates doing well for the Patriots. \u201cI\u2019m not going to sit here and lie like, \u2018Oh well.\u2019 You\u2019re happy for them, but you\u2019re also like, all right, every time somebody goes to the Patriots, they\u2019re going to the Pro Bowl or the Super Bowl. It\u2019s something you feel. A lot of guys left the last year, and it seemed like everybody who left us was going to the playoffs \u2014 (Rams wide receivers) Sammy Watkins and Robert Woods, (49ers receiver) Marquise Goodwin. Everybody who left had a good season. It\u2019s definitely something you look at like, wow, those guys are having success. But the Patriots, they definitely seem to get the best out of the Buffalo Bills.\u201d Browns started all 16 games this season and recorded 144 total tackles, and three pass defenses.\nStay tuned for more.\n________________________________________________________\n"}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/7345292908c24391504759687a4afbd6/5B7F750E/t51.2885-15/e35/29737772_167119900660310_1430941098523492352_n.jpg", "tags": ["#nfl", "#nflnews", "#nfllive", "#nflupdates", "#nflnow", "#espn", "#espnnews", "#espnupdates", "#espnnow", "#sports", "#sportsnation", "#sportsupdates", "#sportscenter", "#football", "#footballlive", "#footballnews", "#footballupdates", "#footballnews", "#rumor", "#rumors", "#updates", "#sportsnews", "#fantasyfootball", "#yahoosports", "#espnfantasyfootball", "#drewbrees", "#neworleanssaints"], "comments": 17, "likes": 1706, "date": "2018-03-02T14:31:32.000Z", "description": "NFL News: According to reports, the New Orleans Saints met with QB Drew Brees\u2019 agent, Tom Condon in Indianapolis on Thursday night to open contract talks.\nBoth sides made significant progress in negotiations and expect to finalize a contract extension \u201csooner rather than later\u201d.

There\u2019s nothing else left for me to believe but they want me to test free agency.\u201d Galette was once a top tier pass-rusher, as he compiled 22 sacks in his last two years with the Saints. But off-field troubles led to his departure from New Orleans and upon coming to Washington, he suffered torn Achilles tendons his first two years.\nGalette appeared in all 16 games this season and recorded 14 tackles, three sacks and one forced fumble. However, Galette still believes he is an \u201celite\u201d edge-rusher, despite his low numbers: \u201cI consider myself elite,\u201d Galette said. \u201cYou look at the numbers, it is what it is. I don\u2019t care what you tell me. I had back-to-back [double-digit sack years] in New Orleans. I think only four players were during that span and I was on pace, had a promising career. I still do, I feel like, but pass rush is so relative. There are so many things and other variables that play into pass rush, so if you just look at my [stats] and it says that I\u2019m top-three in the win percentage and the sacks don\u2019t match, okay, so you look at the tape and you\u2019re like, \u2018Wait, how come the sacks don\u2019t match?\u2019 Well, maybe this guy deserves more playing time. If you give me more playing time, that\u2019s how it works.\u201d \u201cYou need the opportunities. If I had made all the sacks that I missed \u2014 about eight or nine this year \u2014 I\u2019d have double-digit sacks, but that\u2019s almost impossible to do. \u2026 I feel like as long as you\u2019re disrupting the quarterback, then you show that you\u2019re really effective in just how promising that you are with getting after the quarterback.\u201d Galette, 29, played out his one-year/$800K deal and will become an unrestricted free-agent in March."}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/521b4cd234709cd2f074068a14cd779e/5B947649/t51.2885-15/e35/29738929_2092667477683927_6549708887405101056_n.jpg", "tags": ["#nfl", "#nflnews", "#nfllive", "#nflupdates", "#nflnow", "#espn", "#espnnews", "#espnupdates", "#espnnow", "#sports", "#sportsnation", "#sportsupdates", "#sportscenter", "#football", "#footballlive", "#footballnews", "#footballupdates", "#footballnews", "#rumor", "#updates", "#sportsnews", "#fantasyfootball", "#yahoosports", "#espnfantasyfootball", "#nflfreeagency", "#tampabaybuccaneers"], "comments": 19, "likes": 1346, "date": "2018-03-14T14:31:41.000Z", "description": "This Just In: According to reports, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Eagles impending free-agent DT Beau Allen have agreed to a deal.\n________________________________________________________\n"}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/9fffebf4adb116fd436d3ef3de8bcc18/5B7FBFE5/t51.2885-15/e35/30076282_1583411098379427_6860382640931864576_n.jpg", "tags": ["#nfl", "#nflnews", "#nfllive", "#nflupdates", "#nflnow", "#espn", "#espnnews", "#espnupdates", "#espnnow", "#sports", "#sportsnation", "#sportsupdates", "#sportscenter", "#football", "#footballlive", "#footballnews", "#footballupdates", "#footballnews", "#rumor", "#updates", "#sportsnews", "#fantasyfootball", "#yahoosports", "#espnfantasyfootball", "#nflfreeagency", "#washingtonredskins", "#pernellmcphee"], "comments": 25, "likes": 2586, "date": "2018-03-25T00:53:12.000Z", "description": "UPDATE: According to reports, Washington Redskins are expected to sign Former Bears OLB Pernell McPhee.\nMcPhee has informed the Atlanta Falcons that he intends to sign with the Redskins.\nMcPhee, 29, appeared in 13 games for the Bears this past season (five starts) and recorded 21 total tackles, four sacks, two pass defenses, and one forced fumble.\nStay tuned for contract details.\n________________________________________________________\n"}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/fa215c1f721b816bf395a4858b64d190/5B5ACEEF/t51.2885-15/e35/29738696_191067884837703_1001347968382533632_n.jpg", "tags": ["#nfl", "#nflnews", "#nfllive", "#nflupdates", "#nflnow", "#espn", "#espnnews", "#espnupdates", "#espnnow", "#sports", "#sportsnation", "#sportsupdates", "#sportscenter", "#football", "#footballlive", "#footballnews", "#footballupdates", "#footballnews", "#jordynelson", "#oaklandraiders", "#greenbaypackers"], "comments": 25, "likes": 3693, "date": "2018-03-27T18:17:00.000Z", "description": "ICYMI: Newly signed Raiders WR Jordy Nelson opened up about his emotional breakup with the Green Bay Packers after 10 seasons.\n_______________________________________________________\n\"I think the hurt part was, to be honest, was the unwillingness to try to make it work,\" Nelson said to the Wilde & Tausch Show on Monday, via ESPN. \"But then again, it's a business, and they have to do what they think is best.

return to Miami.\nAdam Beasley of the Miami Herald reports that Landry has been notifying his friends and family that he expects to be playing elsewhere next season.\nLandry already hinted that he feels \u201cdisrespected\u201d by how the Dolphins have handled his contract negotiations and is coming to the conclusion that he is unlikely to be back with the team.\nLandry\u2019s agent, Damarius Bilbo, mentioned that his client will not give a \u201chometown discount\u201d to the Dolphins and added that they have yet to hear back from the team following their latest counteroffer.\nLandry is believed to be seeking a deal similar to the one Packers\u2019 WR Davante Adams received, which would pay him an annual salary of $14.5M.\nDolphins VP of football operations Mike Tannenbaum joined the NFL Network broadcast set at the Senior Bowl today and was noncommittal about signing Landry to an extension. Tannenbaum reiterated that they will continue to have discussions regarding their personnel and did not go into further detail about their negotiations with Landry.\nLandry, 25, finished playing out the final year of his 4-year/$3.5M rookie contract and is scheduled to become an unrestricted free-agent in March.\nA report surfaced this morning that the Baltimore Ravens expressed trade interest in Landry last offseason, but they believed the Dolphins\u2019 asking price was too rich. The Ravens will certainly be in the mix for Landry, should he hit the open market.\nLandry appeared in all 16 games this season and caught 112 passes for 987 yards and 9 touchdowns.\nStay tuned for more.\n\n________________________________________________________\n"}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/9d60b979e5108810c6cc476e7de15a24/5B664354/t51.2885-15/e35/29717993_630458783973920_2623353672070856704_n.jpg", "tags": ["#nfl", "#nflnews", "#nfllive", "#nflupdates", "#nflnow", "#espn", "#espnnews", "#espnupdates", "#espnnow", "#sports", "#sportsnation", "#sportsupdates", "#sportscenter", "#football", "#footballlive", "#footballnews", "#footballupdates", "#footballnews", "#rumor", "#rumors", "#updates", "#sportsnews", "#fantasyfootball", "#yahoosports", "#espnfantasyfootball", "#pittsburghsteelers", "#leveonbell"], "comments": 25, "likes": 2056, "date": "2018-03-06T19:44:33.000Z", "description": "News Release: The Pittsburgh Steelers have officially placed the franchise tag on RB Le\u2019Veon Bell.\nThe franchise tag will cost the Steelers $14.544M fully guaranteed for the upcoming season.\nBoth sides will continue to work on a long-term contract extension ahead of July 16th\u2019s deadline.\nBell, 26, started 15 regular season games and rushed for 1,291 yards on 321 carries (4.0 YPC) and nine touchdowns.

We take the approach that we\u2019re going to equip them with every resource that we can.\u201d Lynch and HC Kyle Shanahan have spoken to Foster multiple times following his arrests of alleged domestic violence and marijuana possession. \u201cWe have talked with Reuben and the context in a broad sense of what we discussed with Reuben is just our expectations for him and our expectations for all our players,\u201d Lynch said. \u201cWe have a high standard.

Yeah, that will be something that we have to take into account, whether it\u2019s in free agency, re-signing our own guys or whether it be in the draft.

As long as you\u2019re behind the Cleveland Browns 100 percent, I\u2019m 100 percent behind Josh Gordon.\u2019 \u201cThat\u2019s my mindset.

I think he\u2019s in a good place right now, but we\u2019ll see how this thing moves forward.\u201d The NFL Players Association initially claimed that Gordon was a restricted free-agent, but later backtracked on their statement following clarity from the league office.\nGordon, 26, is indeed listed as an exclusive rights free-agent this offseason, which practically means he\u2019s not going anywhere.\nAll the Browns have to do is offer him a one-year contract for the minimum salary to retain his rights for the 2018 season and it\u2019s something they certainly do in the coming weeks.\nGordon will then become a restricted free-agent in 2019, which means the Browns will have the option to place a first, second, or an original-round tender on him.\nGordon was selected in the 2012 NFL supplemental draft, but had his contract tolled for the 2014 and 2015 seasons due to suspensions.\nGordon was reinstated by the NFL on November 1st of last year and made his first game appearance in nearly three years vs. Chargers in Week 13. Gordon ended up starting the final five games of the 2017 season and caught 18 passes for 335 yards and one touchdown.\nAs the Browns now prepare for the 2018 season, Gordon appears to be firmly involved in their plans moving forward.\n________________________________________________________\n"}, {"img":

Mayfield and UCLA QB Josh Rosen.\nIf USC QB Sam Darnold remains available to the Jets at No. 3 overall, he would reportedly be the \u201coverwhelming favorite\u201d to be the pick. There is a general consensus within their organization that Darnold is the top quarterback of this year\u2019s class, which is why they brought him in for an official Top-30 visit.\nHowever, they know the chances of him falling to them are slim, so they have focused their discussions on Mayfield and Rosen. It\u2019s worth noting that Wyoming QB Josh Allen would be considered if he remained available to them, but there is growing belief that he\u2019ll go No. 1 overall to the Cleveland Browns.\nJets GM Mike Maccagnan was a Mayfield skeptic earlier in the pre-draft process, which gave Rosen the early head-to-head advantage between the two. Maccagnan\u2019s primary concern with Mayfield was how he would handle the New York market, but that worry quickly diminished after their official pre-draft visit with the 2017 Heisman winner.\nBrian Costello of the New York Post describes a \u201chearty debate\u201d among the Jets\u2019 brass about the merits of Rosen and Mayfield and what they bring to the table. There is reportedly a 50/50 split on both prospects within their organization, as some team executives believe Rosen is the most pro-ready passer in this draft.\nWith just four days left until the start of the 2018 NFL Draft, the Jets have not been able to agree on which signal caller is the best fit for their franchise and only time will tell who\u2019ll win their internal debate.\nStay tuned for more.\n\n________________________________________________________\n"}, {"img":

How many people would have said that Matt Cassel would have led us to an 11-5 season? I put my faith and confidence in Bill [Belichick]. He knows his responsibilities. Anything can happen, even if Tom comes in [and is in] tip-top shape.\u201d The Patriots acquired a 2018 first-round pick (No. 23 overall) from the Los Angeles Rams in exchange for WR Brandin Cooks on Tuesday. This now gives them a bevy of premium picks to use for a potential trade up scenario, should an opportunity present itself.\nThere is growing buzz from around the league that Mayfield is on the Patriots\u2019 radar, although their chances of landing him remain slim. Word of the Patriots\u2019 interest in Mayfield is spreading so quickly that the New York Jets and other teams picking inside the top-5 are now aware of the news.\nThe Patriots are set to enter this year\u2019s draft with five picks in the top 100, with four of those being in the top two rounds: No. 23, No. 31, No. 43, No. 63, and No. 95. Even at that, they probably still don\u2019t have the necessary ammo to make the leap into the top-5, but their search for a signal caller has been well documented and they\u2019ll certainly explore all options come draft night.\n________________________________________________________\n"}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/826f8f861957800ad5b71ec1f973d311/5B97A7CC/t51.2885-15/e35/30085970_966400570200078_5144906921190359040_n.jpg", "tags": ["#nfl", "#nflnews", "#nfllive", "#nflupdates", "#nflnow", "#espn", "#espnnews", "#espnupdates", "#espnnow", "#sports", "#sportsnation", "#sportsupdates", "#sportscenter", "#football", "#footballlive", "#footballnews", "#footballupdates", "#footballnews", "#rumor", "#updates", "#sportsnews", "#fantasyfootball", "#yahoosports", "#espnfantasyfootball", "#nflfreeagency"], "comments": 25, "likes": 1652, "date": "2018-03-14T20:15:54.000Z", "description": "NFL News: According to reports, the Los Angeles Chargers are signing Former Broncos TE Virgil Green to a multi-year deal.\n________________________________________________________\n"}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/51e45d662845fcd52ee008c2756ba561/5B64D6B4/t51.2885-15/e35/30078321_1945785905432459_5209630618052198400_n.jpg", "tags": ["#nfl", "#nflnews", "#nfllive", "#nflupdates", "#nflnow", "#espn", "#espnnews", "#espnupdates", "#espnnow", "#sports", "#sportsnation", "#sportsupdates", "#sportscenter", "#football", "#footballlive", "#footballnews", "#footballupdates", "#footballnews", "#rumor", "#updates", "#sportsnews", "#fantasyfootball", "#yahoosports", "#espnfantasyfootball", "#nflfreeagency", "#clevelandbrowns", "#ejgaines"], "comments": 25, "likes": 1409, "date": "2018-03-23T18:06:39.000Z", "description": "UPDATE: According to reports, the Cleveland Browns announced they signed Former Bills CB E.J.

I'll keep all of that in-house, but none of it affects Aaron Donald,\" Snead responded during Cooks' introductory news conference Thursday when asked about Donald's contract situation. \"He's one of 53 and as I've said plenty of times before, we've got that budgeted into the budget. We didn't do all this and forget about him for sure.\" Following their recent acquisitions of CBs Marcus Peters, Aqib Talib, WR Brandin Cooks, and DT Ndamukong Suh the Rams are now $3M over the cap. However, they are projected to have the second most salary cap space behind the New York Jets in 2019 with roughly $81M+ at their disposal.\nDonald, 26, is set to play out his 2018 fifth-year option and is due to make a base salary of $6.892M. The Rams continue to state their intention to ink him to a new deal and do not believe their current cap situation will hinder their ability to do so.\nSnead later went on to say that their busy offseason has them optimistic about contending for many years to come. \"Simply put, 2018 is important, we definitely want to repeat as NFC [West] champions,\" Snead explained. \"A lot of the players we've acquired are young and have evolved to be in the prime of their careers and we'd love to take advantage of that, not just '18 but '19, '20, '21 and moving forward.\u201d Snead continued: \"2018's important, '19's very important and Sean [McVay] and I have been saying the whole time, that guess what, it's '18 but we're still 11 wins behind the '17 season. Just because we've had a flashy 2018 offseason doesn't mean that we're any better this year than we were last year because we're 11 games behind last year's team. But it's up to us to start here in the next couple weeks, like we did last year and make sure we win 12 or more.\" Stay tuned for more.\n\n________________________________________________________\n"}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/d9a00eacd7110f396553ce6277110e1b/5B7F8C39/t51.2885-15/e35/29738196_146214666200149_3484056407995580416_n.jpg", "tags": ["#nfl", "#nflnews", "#nfllive", "#nflupdates", "#nflnow", "#espn", "#espnnews", "#espnupdates", "#espnnow", "#sports", "#sportsnation", "#sportsupdates", "#sportscenter", "#football", "#footballlive", "#footballnews", "#footballupdates", "#footballnews", "#rumor", "#updates", "#sportsnews", "#fantasyfootball", "#yahoosports", "#espnfantasyfootball", "#nflfreeagency", "#detroitlions", "#loganpaulsen"], "comments": 10, "likes": 1318, "date": "2018-03-20T00:40:05.000Z", "description": "NFL News: According to reports, the Detroit Lions hosted free-agent TE Logan Paulsen for a visit today.\nPaulsen, 31, appeared in 14 games this past season as a blocking tight end.\nNo deal is imminent.\n________________________________________________________\n"}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/b455ed8aa6baf0b44fe84251be509401/5B9CA521/t51.2885-15/e35/29716760_317734328756319_202634254922809344_n.jpg", "tags": ["#nfl", "#nflnews", "#nfllive", "#nflupdates", "#nflnow", "#espn", "#espnnews", "#espnupdates", "#espnnow", "#sports", "#sportsnation", "#sportsupdates", "#sportscenter", "#football", "#footballlive", "#footballnews", "#footballupdates", "#footballnews", "#rumor", "#updates", "#sportsnews", "#fantasyfootball", "#yahoosports", "#espnfantasyfootball", "#nflfreeagency", "#deontethompson", "#dallascowboys"], "comments": 25, "likes": 1544, "date": "2018-03-21T15:29:38.000Z", "description": "NFL News: According to reports, the Dallas Cowboys are hosting free-agent WR Deonte Thompson for a visit today.\nThompson, 29, appeared in all 16 games with the Chicago Bears and Bills (10 starts) and caught 38 passes for 555 yards and two touchdowns.\nThe Cowboys are also hosting Former Jaguars WR Allen Hurns for a visit today.\nStay tuned for more.\n________________________________________________________\n"}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/d39961a3d3dfd697c3821f9989601b6f/5B688EE3/t51.2885-15/e35/30603708_163918124272127_3450909521147330560_n.jpg", "tags": ["#nfl", "#nflnews", "#nfllive", "#nflupdates", "#nflnow", "#espn", "#espnnews", "#espnupdates", "#espnnow", "#sports", "#sportsnation", "#sportsupdates", "#sportscenter", "#football", "#footballlive", "#footballnews", "#footballupdates", "#footballnews", "#rumor", "#rumors", "#updates", "#sportsnews", "#fantasyfootball", "#yahoosports", "#espnfantasyfootball", "#sanfrancisco49ers", "#danielkilgore"], "comments": 17, "likes": 1421, "date": "2018-02-15T15:03:14.000Z", "description": "Contract Details: The San Francisco 49ers signed C Daniel Kilgore to a 3-year/$12M contract extension.\nKilgore\u2019s new deal includes $7M in guaranteed money and is now under contract through the 2020 season.\nThe 49ers announced the deal with Kilgore on Wednesday.\n________________________________________________________\n"}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/8bbebd18808e7362f50122a94a7c1f6f/5B65A3B9/t51.2885-15/e35/29716773_454649451621898_532458576132702208_n.jpg", "tags": ["#nfl", "#nflnews", "#nfllive", "#nflupdates", "#nflnow", "#espn", "#espnnews", "#espnupdates", "#espnnow", "#sports", "#sportsnation", "#sportsupdates", "#sportscenter", "#football", "#footballlive", "#footballnews", "#footballupdates", "#footballnews", "#rumor", "#updates", "#sportsnews", "#fantasyfootball", "#yahoosports", "#espnfantasyfootball", "#nflfreeagency", "#philadelphiaeagles", "#michaelbennett"], "comments": 25, "likes": 1884, "date": "2018-03-23T20:15:59.000Z", "description": "UPDATE: The Philadelphia Eagles have released the following statement on DE Michael Bennett\u2019s indictment.\nThe Harris County District Attorney\u2019s office indicted Bennett earlier today for a felony charge of injuring a 66-year-old paraplegic working at NRG stadium to control field access at Super Bowl LI.\nBennett, 32, could face up to 10 years in prison and a $10,000 fine.

Byron Marshall came in and he showed flashes of being a pretty good player after we plucked him from Philly\u2019s practice squad, but he pulled his hamstring pretty bad. We got Kapri Bibbs, we looked at him, he did a nice job for us the last couple games of the year. Obviously, Chris Thompson coming back, Rob Kelley coming back at full strength. Rob had a really good game against the Rams, hurt his ankle and then he was never really full strength. Samaje [Perine] got some quality reps as a rookie running back and did some good things for his first year. We expect major improvement from him. So we have some guys in house that we feel pretty comfortable about, but it would be nice, possibly, to add another, maybe a first- [or] second-down back that can give us a little bit of juice to help us out.\u201d The Redskins currently have RBs Rob Kelley, Samaje Perine, Chris Thompson, and Kapri Bibbs on their roster.\nWashington currently holds the 13th overall pick of the 2018 NFL Draft.

He said he was pushing for a quick return, regardless of him not feeling 100 percent. \u201cI had to deal with it,\u201d Carr said. \u201cI had to do certain things to manage it, but I just didn\u2019t talk about it. I didn\u2019t want it to be an excuse. It was a want more than anything else. I didn\u2019t want it to be a reason. I couldn\u2019t let that be a reason why I couldn\u2019t do A, B or C.\u201d _______________________________________________________\n\nCarr, who was selected to replace Tom Brady in the Pro Bowl on Monday, struggled to find a rhythm this past season.\nIn 15 starts, Carr threw for 3,496 yards, 22 touchdowns and 13 interceptions to go along with a 62.7 completion percentage.\nStay tuned for more.\n________________________________________________________\n"}, {"img":

That essentially narrows down their options to selecting Barkley or NC State DE Bradley Chubb.\nWith that being said, the Giants reportedly favor Barkley over Chubb because of the immediate impact he can make.\nOne of the reasons the Giants may be fading away from potentially taking a quarterback at 2, is because of their inability to agree on who the best signal caller is of the 2018 class. GM Dave Gettleman reportedly covets USC QB Sam Darnold, while other team executives favor UCLA\u2019s Josh Rosen and Wyoming\u2019s Josh Allen.\nIn result, New York seems to be steering away from selecting a quarterback, which bodes well for Barkley\u2019s chances to become a Giant on draft night.\nStay tuned for more.\n________________________________________________________\n"}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/717b6fb348e464e35d842ece672b6ea7/5B5CB5EA/t51.2885-15/e35/29740645_794217890770105_71387089513480192_n.jpg", "tags": ["#nfl", "#nflnews", "#nfllive", "#nflupdates", "#nflnow", "#espn", "#espnnews", "#espnupdates", "#espnnow", "#sports", "#sportsnation", "#sportsupdates", "#sportscenter", "#football", "#footballlive", "#footballnews", "#footballupdates", "#footballnews", "#rumor", "#rumors", "#updates", "#sportsnews", "#fantasyfootball", "#yahoosports", "#espnfantasyfootball", "#indianapoliscolts", "#joshmcdaniels", "#newenglandpatriots"], "comments": 4, "likes": 1027, "date": "2018-01-22T02:58:11.000Z", "description": "UPDATE: According to reports, the Indianapolis Colts have requested a second meeting with Patriots OC Josh McDaniels.\nThe Colts plan to hire McDaniels as their next head coach, but they cannot officially do so until the end of the season.\nHowever, the Colts requested to meet with McDaniels a second time to assemble and finalize his coaching staff this week.\nStay tuned for more.\n________________________________________________________\n"}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/80ad966495415d7d9168634ce5c85abf/5B6974E1/t51.2885-15/e35/30086551_415031825606385_9008726403377528832_n.jpg", "tags": ["#nfl", "#nflnews", "#nfllive", "#nflupdates", "#nflnow", "#espn", "#espnnews", "#espnupdates", "#espnnow", "#sports", "#sportsnation", "#sportsupdates", "#sportscenter", "#football", "#footballlive", "#footballnews", "#footballupdates", "#footballnews", "#rumor", "#updates", "#sportsnews", "#fantasyfootball", "#yahoosports", "#espnfantasyfootball", "#nflfreeagency", "#dwayneharris", "#newyorkgiants"], "comments": 25, "likes": 1737, "date": "2018-03-22T20:35:39.000Z", "description": "This Just In: According to reports, the New York Giants released WR/KR Dwayne Harris.\nHarris, 30, was set to enter the fourth year of his 5-year/$17.5M contract and was due a base salary of $3.225M for the 2018 season.\nThe Giants will free up $2.45M of cap space, while taking on $1.6M of dead money.\n\nHarris appeared in five games for the Giants this past season (1 start) and caught one reception for 13 yards and a touchdown.

Ndamukong Suh.\nSuh, 31, is set to enter the fourth year of his 6-year/$114.375M contract ($59.95 guaranteed) and stands to make a base salary of $16.985M for the 2018 season season. That is not the entire issue with Suh\u2019s contract.\nSuh\u2019s $26.1M cap hit for the upcoming season is the most by any defensive player, the most by any non-quarterback, and third overall behind quarterbacks Jimmy Garoppolo ($37M) and Matthew Stafford ($26.5M). The Dolphins can also trade Suh and save $3.9M in cap space and get compensation in return, as opposed to cutting him loose for nothing. However, it will be difficult for the Dolphins to find a trade partner that would be willing to absorb Suh\u2019s contract.\nWith that being said, Miami is likely to release him outright, which would save them $3.9M of cap space. In this case, they\u2019d be taking on $22.2M of dead money.\nMiami can also designate Suh as a post-June 1 cut, which would save the team $8.5M in cap space, while absorbing $17.6M of dead money. This is the most ideal option for the Dolphins if they decide to move on from Suh.\nSuh started all 16 games this season and posted 48 total tackles, 4.5 sacks, two forced fumbles, and two pass defenses.\nStay tuned for more.\n________________________________________________________\n"}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/b6d241705856818e2505318e64173902/5B68B2FB/t51.2885-15/e35/29738748_2019710651682919_1221395012860772352_n.jpg", "tags": ["#nfl", "#nflnews", "#nfllive", "#nflupdates", "#nflnow", "#espn", "#espnnews", "#espnupdates", "#espnnow", "#sports", "#sportsnation", "#sportsupdates", "#sportscenter", "#football", "#footballlive", "#footballnews", "#footballupdates", "#footballnews", "#rumor", "#updates", "#sportsnews", "#fantasyfootball", "#yahoosports", "#espnfantasyfootball", "#nfldraft", "#aldonsmith", "#oaklandraiders", "#sanfrancisco49ers"], "comments": 25, "likes": 3556, "date": "2018-04-08T15:10:33.000Z", "description": "UPDATE: According to reports, Former Raiders OLB Aldon Smith was arrested again for violating a condition of his bail.\nSmith was in court last Thursday for allegedly violating a protective order after his arrest for domestic violence.

Jaguars @ No. 1 New England Patriots\nChampionship Sunday is officially here. The Jacksonville Jaguars will be looking to book their first trip to the Super Bowl, while the New England Patriots continue their quest to repeat as champions.\nThis matchup is interesting because the Jaguars' defense matches up very well with the Patriots' high-powered offense. I do believe the Jags have a chance to pull the upset due to their No. 1 ranked rush offense. I expect Leonard Fournette to have success on the ground against a New England defense that finished 20th in rush defense. Winning time of possession for Jacksonville will be crucial for their chances to escape Foxborough with a victory. Keeping Brady off the field should be their top priority and I think they will do a nice job of accomplishing that today. I look for Todd Wash to keep his defensive philosophy the same. Consistent blitzing, man coverage, and aggressive playcalling in short-yardage situations. In result, the Jags will create havoc and disrupt Brady's rhythm in the pocket. I expect Jacksonville to pile up at least six sacks on Brady and it will limit the Patriots' offensive efficiency throughout. However, I still think the brain power of Belichick, Josh McDaniels, and Brady will be able to make timely second-half adjustments that will pay dividends for them in the long-run. Rob Gronkowski may face Jalen Ramsey, but I still look for him to reach 80+ yards receiving and a touchdown. The Patriots' defense has feasted on turnovers during the playoffs, and I expect them to come away with an interception off Bortles to swing momentum their way in the fourth quarter. This game will come down to the wire, with Jacksonville leading the game with under five minutes to play in regulation. But, somehow, someway, Brady will find a way to engineer a game-winning drive to send the Patriots to Super Bowl 52. New England wins a thriller, 23-21.\n"}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/f21a7a6dd23249e5a0457246d58a10e5/5B5F5773/t51.2885-15/e35/29740196_572471366445163_2697566192935108608_n.jpg", "tags": ["#nfl", "#nflnews", "#nfllive", "#nflupdates", "#nflnow", "#espn", "#espnnews", "#espnupdates", "#espnnow", "#sports", "#sportsnation", "#sportsupdates", "#sportscenter", "#football", "#footballlive", "#footballnews", "#footballupdates", "#footballnews", "#rumor", "#updates", "#sportsnews", "#fantasyfootball", "#yahoosports", "#espnfantasyfootball", "#nflfreeagency", "#newyorkgiants", "#odellbeckhamjr"], "comments": 25, "likes": 4284, "date": "2018-03-28T16:22:20.000Z", "description": "UPDATE: According to reports, the New York Giants are seeking two first-round picks in return for WR Odell Beckham Jr.\nAs previously reported, the Giants are not inclined to trade Beckham, but they have set their asking price, should a team be willing to meet it.\nThe Los Angeles Rams have reportedly offered their 2018 first-round pick (No. 23 overall) for Beckham, but the Giants are not at all interest in pursuing that trade.\nStay tuned for more.\n________________________________________________________\n"}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/281cb0fb8c8beef3fcdc92feefc20678/5B69A61B/t51.2885-15/e35/29737352_244640252775620_5247492945199759360_n.jpg", "tags": ["#nfl", "#nflnews", "#nfllive", "#nflupdates", "#nflnow", "#espn", "#espnnews", "#espnupdates", "#espnnow", "#sports", "#sportsnation", "#sportsupdates", "#sportscenter", "#football", "#footballlive", "#footballnews", "#footballupdates", "#footballnews", "#rumor", "#updates", "#sportsnews", "#fantasyfootball", "#yahoosports", "#espnfantasyfootball", "#nflfreeagency", "#carolinapanthers", "#jeremiahsirles"], "comments": 11, "likes": 1083, "date": "2018-03-23T15:44:59.000Z", "description": "UPDATE: According to reports, the Carolina Panthers signed Former Vikings OL Jeremiah Sirles.\nSirles, 26, appeared in 14 games for the Vikings this past season, including four starts at left guard.\nStay tuned for contract details.\n________________________________________________________\n"}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/6ebbbd547932d2771fe48382a0764c47/5B65228E/t51.2885-15/e35/30605456_192144738233311_4171924226795634688_n.jpg", "tags": ["#nfl", "#nflnews", "#nfllive", "#nflupdates", "#nflnow", "#espn", "#espnnews", "#espnupdates", "#espnnow", "#sports", "#sportsnation", "#sportsupdates", "#sportscenter", "#football", "#footballlive", "#footballnews", "#footballupdates", "#footballnews", "#rumor", "#updates", "#sportsnews", "#fantasyfootball", "#yahoosports", "#espnfantasyfootball", "#nfldraft", "#denverbroncos", "#joshallen", "#wyomingfootball"], "comments": 25, "likes": 2023, "date": "2018-04-09T14:10:48.000Z", "description": "2018 NFL Draft: According to reports, the Denver Broncos are hosting Wyoming QB Josh Allen for an official Top-30 visit today.\nThe Broncos currently possess the 5th overall pick of the NFL Draft.\nAllen accumulated 4,912 pass yards, 41 touchdowns, and 21 interceptions to go along with a 56.2 completion percentage over the course of 26 collegiate games.

This now gives them a bevy of premium picks to use for a potential trade up into the top-10, should a quarterback of their liking be available.\nThe Patriots are set to enter this year\u2019s draft with five picks in the top 100, with four of those being in the top two rounds: No. 23, No. 31, No. 43, No. 63, and No. 95.\nNo one knows which signal caller is on the the Patriots\u2019 radar, but all signs are pointing toward them selecting their future franchise quarterback if the right opportunity presents itself.\nStay tuned for more.\n\n________________________________________________________\n"}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/ff11f53e228b7561bb35bfe4441be7b4/5B789A2E/t51.2885-15/e35/29717376_1029633213841455_7058827082242981888_n.jpg", "tags": ["#nfl", "#nflnews", "#nfllive", "#nflupdates", "#nflnow", "#espn", "#espnnews", "#espnupdates", "#espnnow", "#sports", "#sportsnation", "#sportsupdates", "#sportscenter", "#football", "#footballlive", "#footballnews", "#footballupdates", "#footballnews", "#rumor", "#updates", "#sportsnews", "#fantasyfootball", "#yahoosports", "#espnfantasyfootball", "#nfldraft", "#newyorkjets", "#samdarnold"], "comments": 7, "likes": 1586, "date": "2018-04-10T19:02:58.000Z", "description": "2018 NFL Draft: According to reports, the New York Jets are scheduled to host USC QB Sam Darnold for an official Top-30 visit this week.\nThis is an interesting development, considering that the Jets were not planning to meet with Darnold as of last week.\nHowever, they have made the decision to use one of their exclusive Top-30 visits on Darnold and will meet with him in the coming days.\nIt\u2019s hard to believe that Darnold will remain on the board when the Jets go on the clock at No. 3 overall.

So I\u2019ll love to stay in Baltimore and continue my legacy and try to be the second-best linebacker to finish out there.\u201d _______________________________________________________\nMosley, 25, is set to play out his 2018 fifth-year option and will become an unrestricted free-agent after next season.\nWith that being said, Mosley is confident that a long-term extension will eventually get done: \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure something will get worked out, but I just focus on football,\u201d Mosley said. \u201cI just leave that to the head of the front office and my agent. I just let them work that out. All I can do is stay healthy and play football.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not really focused on that. I feel like I put in all the work I could and shed a lot of blood, sweat and tears, so I feel like my play will do all the talking when it comes time for that.\u201d Mosley finished the 2017 season with 132 tackles (8th in NFL), one sack, two interceptions with one of them being returned for a touchdown, three forced fumbles, and seven pass defenses.\nMosley will make a base salary of $8.7M for the 2018 season.\nStay tuned for more.\n________________________________________________________\n"}, {"img":

The same knee injury that hindered him at the beginning of the season forced him to miss Weeks 3-5.

However, the Steelers will not part ways with him for cheap and will be seeking respectable draft compensation in return.\nBryant, 26, is set to enter the final year of his 4-year/$2.69M rookie contract and stands to make a base salary of $705K for the 2018 season.\nBryant appeared in 15 games this season (8 starts) and hauled in 50 receptions for 603 yards and three touchdowns.\nStay tuned for more.\n________________________________________________________\n"}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/6e86934cf4e1d96d2d60c21dfd83b6e9/5B5F0196/t51.2885-15/e35/30076946_179535829339058_8004255091827671040_n.jpg", "tags": ["#nfl", "#nflnews", "#nfllive", "#nflupdates", "#nflnow", "#espn", "#espnnews", "#espnupdates", "#espnnow", "#sports", "#sportsnation", "#sportsupdates", "#sportscenter", "#football", "#footballlive", "#footballnews", "#footballupdates", "#footballnews", "#rumor", "#rumors", "#updates", "#sportsnews", "#fantasyfootball", "#yahoosports", "#espnfantasyfootball", "#robertquinn", "#miamidolphins", "#losangelesrams"], "comments": 25, "likes": 1949, "date": "2018-03-02T22:39:07.000Z", "description": "UPDATE: TRADE DETAILS\ud83d\udea8: The Rams will receive a 2018 4th-round pick from Miami in the trade.\nBoth teams will swap 2018 6th-round picks.\nQuinn, 27, appeared in 15 games this season (14 starts) and recorded 32 total tackles, 8.5 sacks, and two forced fumbles.\nQuinn, a two-time Pro Bowler (2013, 2014) is set to enter the third year of his 4-year/$57M contract and is due to make base salaries of $10.33M and $11.81M for the 2018 and 2019 seasons.\nThe trade will not become official until March 14th, the start of the new league year.\n________________________________________________________\n"}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/983d363705803c1dd259e53fefe9a445/5B653156/t51.2885-15/e35/30076236_290565968146516_7639295825012588544_n.jpg", "tags": ["#nfl", "#nflnews", "#nfllive", "#nflupdates", "#nflnow", "#espn", "#espnnews", "#espnupdates", "#espnnow", "#footballlive", "#footballnews", "#footballupdates", "#footballnews", "#rumor", "#rumors", "#updates", "#sportsnews", "#fantasyfootball", "#yahoosports", "#espnfantasyfootball", "#philadelphiaeagles", "#dougpederson", "#ducestaley", "#mikegroh"], "comments": 9, "likes": 1339, "date": "2018-02-19T16:31:56.000Z", "description": "NFL News: According to reports, Eagles HC Doug Pederson is scheduled to interview RBs coach Duce Staley and WRs coach Mike Groh for their vacant offensive coordinator job today.\nHowever, Pederson will remain the team\u2019s primary play-caller for the 2018 season.\nStaley, 42, has served as the Eagles\u2019 running backs coach since 2013.\nGroh, 46, just finished his first season as the Eagles\u2019 wide receivers coach.\nStay tuned for more.\n________________________________________________________\n"}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/b9cf5853a24a16e733143af5a59c106b/5B657FC6/t51.2885-15/e35/30078880_2143193205697932_6816076630184689664_n.jpg", "tags": ["#nfl", "#nflnews", "#nfllive", "#nflupdates", "#nflnow", "#espn", "#espnnews", "#espnupdates", "#espnnow", "#sports", "#sportsnation", "#sportsupdates", "#sportscenter", "#football", "#footballlive", "#footballnews", "#footballupdates", "#2018nfldraft", "#mockdraft", "#scoutingcombine"], "comments": 25, "likes": 1929, "date": "2018-02-28T03:32:17.000Z", "description": "Pre-Mock Draft Notes\ud83d\udccb: As mentioned in the first post, the Jets move back to No. 11 in a trade with the Dolphins.

This time it\u2019s the Cardinals jumping ahead of the Redskins to grab a signal caller. While it\u2019s hard to imagine Darnold falling outside of the top-10, I think he encounters a draft day slide and finds a new home in Arizona.\nAs for the Bengals, I think they still get their top target in Mike McGlinchey, despite moving down three spots.\nI know many draft experts are mocking Derrius Guice to the Lions at No. 20 overall, but something tells me Ronald Jones is a dark horse for Detroit if they choose to select a running back in round one. Jones is an ultra talented back that comes with good size, speed, and big play ability. Matt Patricia and Jim Bob Cooter would equip themselves with a dynamic back that would bring new life to Detroit\u2019s stagnant rushing attack.
