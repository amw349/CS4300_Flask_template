A Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention study found that Muslim immigrants were 23 times more likely to commit rape than were Swedish born men. BBC has also reported that large numbers of Muslim men caused havoc throughout Germany on New Year's Eve. \"The mayor of Cologne has summoned police for crisis talks after about 80 women reported sexual assaults and muggings by men on New Year's Eve. The scale of the attacks on women at the city's central railway station has shocked Germany. About 1,000 drunk and aggressive young men were involved. City police chief Wolfgang Albers called it a completely new dimension of crime and said the men were of Arab or North African appearance, he said.\" There is no doubt when you have a such a severe clash of civilizations in a short time it will create chaos.

In the 1960s it was undoubtedly true that Americans of color were not given the same opportunities to succeed as white Americans in many parts of the country. Today, that has changed and our nation in 1991 confirmed a black American to the highest court in the land in Clarence Thomas and America elected a black President in 2008 in Barack Obama.

It was difficult not being swept by emotion when reading different reports of what happened to a young girl over a two year span in the British towns of Keighley and Bradford. In a unanimous verdict following a seven week trial eleven men aged between 19 and 63, were found guilty of repeatedly raping a young British schoolgirl. Breitbart is reporting, \"The court heard how she was called 'little white slag' and 'white bastard' as she wept on the floor and was raped by five men in succession on one occasion.\" The ring leader of the deranged group is a man named Ahmed Al-Arif Choudhury who authorities say is thought to have fled abroad and was not on trial. The three animals pictured above are named Mohamed Akram (63), Faisal Khan (27), and Nazir Khan (23). All have been convicted and will be sentenced next week. Akram (63) is a taxi driver who was convicted of raping the 14 year old in his taxi car multiple times. It is worth noting at least five of the eleven men convicted are believed to be recent U.K. Immigrants from Syria with little documentation. As disturbing as this story is I felt it was critical the facts of this case be shared to inform you of what is going on in free societies around the world today. The liberal media does not want to tell you stories like this for fear they will be labeled \"intolerant\". It is a pretty sad realization that news outlets will hide facts from their stories simply to further their leftist agenda.

Halladay is a former eight-time All-Star pitcher for the Blue Jays (1998-2009) and the Phillies (2010-2013). He won the Cy Young Award in 2003 and 2010. Halladay is survived by his two sons, Ryan and Braden, and his wife, Brandy. Horrible story and prayers to his family.

Celebrities have a massive platform whether you like it or not, and they are entitled to their political opinion just the way anyone else is.

A separate Pew Research Poll which was released December 15th shows the American public sides with Republicans over Democrats 46 percent to 34 percent on the issue of terrorism and 42 to 37 percent on the economy. This is without question due to the ineffective leadership of the current administration as evidenced by the fact only 25% of Americans are currently satisfied with the direction of the country. The clear disapproval of the direction of the country by the American people provides an incredible opportunity for a Republican to win back the White House in 2016.

Evidence is mounting that the FBI did not behave properly while looking at Secretary Clinton and her staff. We don't try cases here, but the FBI and the Justice Department have a lot of explaining to do on the email front. The same thing happened in 2013 when an IRS boss, Lois Lerner, was accused of illegally targeting conservative groups for audits. Lerner pleaded the Fifth Amendment in the case and was never really held legally accountable. Attorney General Eric Holder refused to explain and President Obama told me there was 'not even a smidgeon of corruption.' But Talking Points believes there is now enough evidence of corruption in the Justice Department that an independent prosecutor should be appointed. We all know that Mr. Obama will not do that, but he should. We need honest government.\" Attorneys Jay Sekulow and Chris Fedeli, both of whom head legal groups that are suing the Obama administration, entered the No Spin Zone to react. \"The struggle continues,\" Fedeli said, \"but two federal judges have said that Secretary Clinton was evading the Freedom of Information Act. So we are moving along and we think that without question Secretary Clinton evaded FOIA with her server, which was designed to keep federal records private. There will be consequences in the federal courts.\" Sekulow, whose organization is pursuing the IRS for targeting conservative groups, also expressed optimism. \"We have the actual emails where this was directed from Washington and signed by Lois Lerner. This goes much higher than Lois Lerner and we are making the government do its job. It is also inexcusable that Attorney General Loretta Lynch met with Bill Clinton, whose wife was going to be interviewed by the FBI.\" Full link in bio. What are your thoughts?

This story comes from @muricans_only and it is for a cause which I believe is well worth supporting and I just wanted to bring further awareness to it. This next part is taken from his account.\n\"A friend of mine's mother has recently passed away, Retired Lt. Col. Frances Dobinson. She served in the U.S. Army for 31 years and her family wants to donate money in her name to @k9sforwarriors. This non-profit is \"dedicated to providing service canines to our warriors suffering from [PTSD], traumatic brain injury, and/or military sexual trauma as a result of military service post 9/11.\" Here is a short excerpt form The Dobinson family.\n\"Since she recently passed on 01/10/2016 the family has wanted to honor her by making a donation in her name to charity. We wanted to choose a charity that would combine my mothers love for the military and animals. So we have chosen the charity K9's for Warriors. This is an organization that specializes in pairing service and companion animals to Veterans with PTSD and other disabilities. After seeing first hand how my mothers dog helped her during her recovery I know how much the right animal can help. Veterans like my mom deserve our respect and those who came home with mental injuries need our help. So we ask that you please donate so we can all make a difference in the life of vet by giving them a dog that will help them heal.\" Again as most of you know this account is not one which promotes other accounts unless it supports a positive cause. However, I believe this cause is certainly worthwhile as it is reported 22 U.S. veterans commit suicide every single day with the vast majority being those who suffer from PTSD. These men and women risk their lives to protect us and our freedom and if I can use the platform of this account to promote something that helps them I believe that is well worth posting. Thank you for reading and consider helping out and donating. I've attached the link to my bio.

The reason is because if someone gives up looking for work but still doesn't have a job they are no longer considered unemployed, thus deceptively lowering the unemployment rate. Larry Elder pointed this out on Hannity Wednesday and argued that the labor participation rate and average American wage are both far more accurate measures for determining economic growth. Both stats reveal whether or not Americans are working and have good paying jobs and currently under the Obama administration both those statistics have declined dramatically. Couple that with 47 million Americans dependent on food stamps and another 50 million stuck in poverty and it is actually impossible to argue that Barack Obama's left wing economic policies have strengthened America.

They were military veterans, husbands and fathers who served the city of Dallas before being ambushed and killed by a racist anti-police 'Black Lives Matter' supporter Thursday night. Their names are Brent Thompson, Michael Krol, Patrick Zamarripa, Mike Smith and Lorne Ahrens. Thompson, 43, who joined the DART police department in 2009, was the first member of the 27-year-old department to die in the line of duty. A former Marine, he had married a fellow police officer just two weeks ago, officials said. Krol, 40, was a Redford, Mich. native who joined the Dallas Police Department in 2007 after working for four previous years as a sheriff's deputy in Wayne County, Mich. His mother, Susan Elkhe, released a statement Friday saying her son was \"living a dream of being a police officer ... He knew the danger of the job but he never shied away from his duty.\" Zamarripa, 32, a five-year Dallas Police Department veteran, served three tours in Iraq with the Navy, according to The Washington Post. He was married and was the father of a 2-year-old daughter. Smith, 55, served for seven years in the U.S. Army. He joined the Dallas Police Department in 1989 after graduating from Lamar University. A native of Port Arthur, Texas, Smith is survived by Heidi, his wife of 17 years, and daughters Victoria and Caroline. He was a volunteer at the YMCA and his church, and was involved in working with kids at risk, and once developed a racquetball program for kids at the local YMCA, a Dallas police newsletter from 2009 said. Ahrens, 48, had been with the Dallas Police Department since 2002. It is being reported Ahrens' work desk was near that of his wife Katrina, who is a Dallas police detective. The couple had two children, 10-year-old Sorcha, and 8-year-old Magnus.

He said, \"It makes it incredibly challenging to determine who is a member of ISIS and who isn't.\" The Wall Street Journal has also reported that one of the attackers in Paris was a Syrian refugee who got into Greece with a fake Syrian passport. I have posted about this issue before but it really amazes me how our president can call for bringing in refugees from ISIS controlled areas which in my opinion gambles with the lives of American citizens.

After another big victory for Bernie Sanders in Oregon and a virtual tie in Kentucky on Tuesday, Sanders has continued his strong momentum and Democratic voters do not appear at all excited for a Clinton presidency. The problem for Sanders is Hillary Clinton has such a massive lead with the super delegates (establishment party leaders) that there is almost zero chance Bernie can win the nomination. This has led to absolute hysteria from Sanders supporters and it was evidence at the Nevada Democratic convention Saturday where protestors were violent and some were arrested. Party chair Roberta Lange who Sanders supporters say has \"rigged the system\" has also received multiple death threats from Bernie supporters.

Louis F.

Eight other Marines were injured in the attack on the newly established base, which is roughly 60 miles outside of Mosul. Cardin was deployed with the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit, which sent a detachment of Marines to Makhmur to guard the base. The Marines were supporting Operation Inherent Resolve, the U.S. military's campaign against ISIS.\" News is also breaking that this particularly attack will lead to an increased American troop presence in the fight against ISIS in Iraq and Syria.

The Primary Model consists of two ingredients: The swing of the electoral pendulum, and the outcomes of primaries. After two terms in office, the presidential party in power loses more often than not. President Barack Obama has not left such a legacy for a Democratic successor. On the primary front, Trump has wound up as the stronger of the two presidential nominees. He won many more primaries than did Clinton.

However President Barack Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry remained confident that despite the ayatollahs of Iran horrific human rights record and their repeatedly calling for the destruction of Israel, they could be trusted to tamper down their nuclear program. Well just as I predicted along with the vast majority of my followers, the Iranian's have already broken the agreement by restarting their ballistic missile program. As if that wasn't enough they also recently sent a test rocket within 1,500 feet of an American ship. Multiple U.S. Generals have already declared this a clear violation of international maritime law and an act of defiance by the Iranians. It is incredible our leaders could be so naive in trusting this crazed regime and they have now not only jeopardized the security and safety of our closest ally in Israel but they also have endangered the entire civilized world.

King once famously declared, \"I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.\" I definitely agree we need to get back to judging people based on their character and not base society on filling quotas or other programs that do not promote equality. Liberty president Jerry Falwell compared Trump to Dr. King because they \"both stood up for speaking the truth publicly even if what they were saying was not comfortable or popular\". Falwell went on to say Trump \"speaks the common sense truth that so many have wanted to hear.\" Many on the left have been critical of President Falwell inviting Trump to speak on Martin Luther King Day but Falwell has defended the decision explaining how he has invited all of the presidential candidates to speak at the university.

They created a 14 page list of demands for the school which include, \"The demand for black student leaders be provided a $8.20/hr stipend for their continuous organizing efforts around the well-being of Black people on Oberlin\u2019s campus and the creation of exclusive black safe-spaces on campus, including segregated spaces in the library and science building.\" This is becoming very concerning for our society, instead of promoting equality and unity these protestors are actually demanding segregation in their school. The absurd list of demands even goes after the schools food options on campus. Campus Reform states, \"Another protest was organized in response to a lack of traditional meals and authentic food ideas at Oberlin dining halls. Members of the Black Student Union even called for a decrease in the amount of cream used in meals because 'Black American food doesn\u2019t have much cream in it.' These list of demands are incredibly disturbing as they seem intent on creating a society where tension between races increases and we are less unified as a people. What ever happened to following the great words of MLK that \"We should judge people by the content of their character not by the color of their skin\"? I've attached the full article to my header.

Questioning any part of L-P or identifying another with a pronoun they don\u2019t see fit somehow labels you a bigot of some sort. Now, the idea behind this is wanting everyone to be happy and comfortable, or equality. This is something we all want, but the very nature of forcing L-P on society restricts those who believe in only 2 sexes with LGBT. Why did it need to expand so far? Some of the letters do not even logically make sense, and seem made up. So let me be clear, there\u2019s nothing wrong with identifying yourself as any of these sexualities and we\u2019ll accept you regardless, but do not force personal rules and beliefs on others. Shunning those who don\u2019t correctly use or identify all of L-P is absurd. Especially when considering teachers forcing this upon their classrooms...

However, I must admit I never thought it would get to the point where a leftist university would do everything it could to protect a professor who is clearly a radical Islamic and a possible ISIS recruiter. Multiple news outlets including Time and the New York Times have confirmed that the FBI is in fact investigating Professor Julio C. Pino for suspicions he is an Islamic State recruiter. According to Kent State the school launched an ongoing investigation after Pino posted on a Jihadist blog a few years ago. Pino also wrote a piece in a school newspaper praising Palestinian terrorist Ayat Al-Akras who murdered two Israelis in a suicide bombing. Pino also drew attention in 2011 for interrupting an Israeli diplomats speech by standing and yelling \"Death to Israel\" in the middle of it. Pino has openly admitted he is a devout follower of Islam but denied allegations he has pressured students to join ISIS. I personally find it sickening that this man has a job educating young people at a public university. I believe he should not only be fired but there is clear evidence he has supported terrorism and he should be prosecuted. Comment your thoughts below and share.

This is clearly a sign of the radical Islamic regime controlling Iran flexing their muscle in the face of the United States and a totally violation of the catastrophic Nuclear Deal that also gave Iran 150 billion dollars. Now Israel is demanding world leaders condemn Iran and punish them but not surprisingly President Obama has done next to nothing and the European Union said they \"condemn the Iranians rocket tests, but will take no action\".

It infuriates me because it should not represent the \"Top 20\" institution of higher learning I was promised. George Yancy a professor at Emory wrote in his New York Times Piece, \"After all, it is painful to let go of your \u2018white innocence,\u2019 to use this letter as a mirror, one that refuses to show you what you want to see, one that demands that you look at the lies that you tell yourself so that you don\u2019t feel the weight of responsibility for those who live under the yoke of whiteness, your whiteness. I'm asking you speak to, to admit to, the racist poison that is inside you.\" Not only am I infuriated and insulted by what this radical wrote, I am embarrassed. I am embarrassed because as a varsity student-athlete at Emory I put on the uniform and represent the school, and that includes this hate-filled lunatic. Seriously, we must ask ourselves, how much hatred must this man possess to tell all white Americans they have a poison inside them? People who share Yancy's beliefs are hate-filled extremists who do not love their country, it's people, or the beliefs it was founded upon. They identify more with a racist movement instead of the colorblind American dream. It's sad to think to myself what would happen if I wrote a paper in this mans class which portrayed my conservative beliefs of support for individual responsibility and personal accountability. Of course we know what would happen, I would immediately be failed for speaking my mind. We need to wake up folks, we cannot allow this to continue in our schools for the sake of the country. In the coming weeks I hope to further discussions on this issue with the Emory Newspaper and the school dean where I will request for this professor to be fired for clearly having a liberal agenda and not being an objective educator. I am asking all of my followers to please share this with friends, news organizations, or anyone who can bring awareness to this issue and help fight the severe lack of ideological diversity on college campuses.

The mansion, which has 10 bedrooms, 13 full bathrooms and six half bathrooms, will be donated to Camp Barnabas, which \u201cis a unique ministry providing Christian camping experiences to people with special needs and chronic illnesses, along with their siblings,\u201d according to its website.\n\u201cThere are tons of amazing charities in southwest Missouri,\u201d Cole Hamels said in a news release. \u201cOut of all of these, Barnabas really pulled on our heartstrings. Seeing the faces, hearing the laughter, reading the stories of the kids they serve; there is truly nothing like it. Barnabas makes dreams come true, and we felt called to help them in a big way.\u201d "}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/cb6ac3f11ee9e58051b8efa9cc7920e7/5B95E9F7/t51.2885-15/e35/19437037_116591665617086_5893969554282905600_n.jpg", "tags": [], "comments": 7, "likes": 366, "date": "2017-06-28T00:19:09.000Z", "description": "@liberalbull_ is backstage with Tucker tonight!

Republican Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina has been one of the most outspoken against Obama's proposal. \"As the president rushes to transfer detainees out of Guantanamo Bay, we have been given a clear picture of exactly the type of terrorist he is talking about releasing,\u201d Scott, R-S.C., said in a statement Thursday. \u201cThese terrorists want another San Bernardino, another Paris, and by basing his national security policies on a political promise to close Guantanamo, I fear the president is only increasing the danger to our nation and our people.\u201d I fully agree with the very popular senator Scott of South Carolina, the president is intent on closing the detention center simply to fulfill a 2008 election promise for his legacy. What is most concerning is because the rate of reengagement to terrorism by former Gitmo detainees is so high this decision will not only endanger Americans it will also contribute to the instability and carnage in the Middle East.

Black Lives Matter activists at Emory University protested and blocked traffic on campus due to what they claim is severe \"inequality and oppression\" on campus. They also provided a list of demands for the school which include \"higher compensation for black staff and administrators\" and \"increased funding and decreased policing for black student organizations\" and many more that do everything except promote equality. The local Emory movement has joined forces with the umbrella organization Atlanta Black Students United (ATLBSU) Coalition, which has announced that it will hold Emory University \"publicly accountable\" for not satisfying the demands by the requested deadline. They say they will \"increase resistance\" and that \"their next step will be calculated\". As a student at Emory, I can personally attest to Emory being a private institution that bends over backwards to make sure every student feels fully included and has the tools to succeed on campus. The student body at Emory is highly intelligent and one of the most diverse in the country. I have not seen one instance of oppression or maltreatment whatsoever. For these students to come to my university and hurl insults while dragging the American flag through the ground like a rag doll is not only insulting and shameful, but it does not promote equal rights whatsoever. I fully credit this movement for creating a wave of racial tension on campus that did not exist before the movement's inception. Comment below and share.

The officiant who led the 17-year-old\u2019s memorial service on Feb. 17 said Joaquin was excited for Wade\u2019s return to the Heat, which happened a week earlier. Joaquin\u2019s connection to Wade will continue. His parents revealed Sunday on the Univision talk show Al Punto that their son was buried wearing his Dwyane Wade jersey. Wade saw the news circulate on Twitter and responded Sunday afternoon by saying, \u201cYou\u2019re about to make me cry. God has given me this unbelievable opportunity to play at this level, and I understand what comes with that from a role model standpoint.\u201d A truly emotional story, and credit to @dwyanewade for being such a positive influence on Joaquin. @miamiherald "}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/f2e0a822c270f267eb2219b4ece48bbd/5B7D45A4/t51.2885-15/e35/12748278_1091276814226733_78257018_n.jpg", "tags": ["#liberalbull", "#tedcruz", "#marcorubio", "#senator", "#cuba", "#hispanic", "#cnn", "#debate", "#gop", "#republican", "#immigrants", "#oppurtunity", "#america", "#latino", "#presidential", "#race"], "comments": 25, "likes": 894, "date": "2016-02-26T02:19:11.000Z", "description": "I totally agree with this comment by Texas Senator Ted Cruz.

The Rooney Rule is the name for the mandatory requirement of NFL teams to interview a minority football coach while conducting their search for a head coach. The unfortunate consequence of this rule (like most liberal policies) is that it actually ends up hurting the very people it was intended to help. Smith made the argument yesterday on his show that it has gotten to the point where now NFL teams will conduct a \"fake interview\" with a minority coach simply to comply with the leagues Rooney Rule. He went on to say, \"When you look at the results of what transpired, one could make the argument we are officially taking a step back. How is it American that we now have black men scared to take an interview because their interview is simply to comply with the Rooney Rule and it will be counted against them later?\" I agree with Smith in this case, maybe the NFL should try interviewing and hiring coaches based on their ability and not force teams to conduct fake interviews just to satisfy some dumb liberal policy.

Bernie Sanders who new polls show holds a substantial lead in New Hampshire came out strongly against the raids when their planning was first reported last month.

Regardless, because the mainstream media will only show you negative comments made by Donald Trump from the past I feel it is critical to honestly inform the public of the deeds of Hillary Clinton. In the mid-1980s, journalist Roy Reed interviewed Hillary Clinton where she bragged about defending a rapist. \u201cHe took a lie detector test! I had him take a polygraph, which he passed, which forever destroyed my faith in polygraphs,\u201d Clinton said about her client Thomas Alfred Taylor, who raped Shelton in 1975, laughing. Clinton also laughed in the video about saving the child rapist from a \u201cmiscarriage of justice.\u201d He served one year in county jail, with two months shaved off his sentence for the time he already served.

This dramatic lead in New Hampshire and a now very close race in Iowa shows how little excitement even Democrat voters have for Hillary Clinton. Clinton was presumed to be headed for an easy primary season but with an FBI investigation on her E-mail situation and more information exposing her dishonesty and incompetence regarding Benghazi, a socialist senator with no understanding of the economy is able to make it a close race. I still believe it is unlikely Sanders will win the nomination because he is someone who wants to totally shatter American businesses with heavy taxation and regulation and even Democrats should understand that. However, it is clear Hillary Clinton's reputation is severely damaged as evidenced by over 60% of people saying she is not trustworthy in polls. Either way unless the Democrats can bring out another legitimate presidential candidate the GOP should have a tremendous opportunity to take back the White House in 2016.

Are they that insecure with their beliefs and protest that they won't let a student take photos of what's happening for the world to see? To make matters even worse there is some moron professor in that video participating in the bullying of the journalist. Please share this and comment below.

Remember, this is the event that triggered mass riots from Black Lives Matter supporters in Baltimore and even prompted President Obama to condemn the actions of the police officers involved despite the fact he had zero evidence to make those accusations at the time. Today, liberals are still complaining of racism in this case despite the reality that the judge in the case was black, the mayor of the city is black, the police chief is black, and three of the officers involved were black.

I will be incredibly disturbed if President Obama does not mention this in his State of the Union. This is another instance of Iran flaunting their muscle to the U.S. and the president must address the American people with what is happening regarding the safety of our servicemen. Amazingly according to an Obama official on CNN, \"The president has no plans to address the issue tonight.\" Even more appalling is the fact the president will reportedly discuss the Iranian nuclear and it's \"benefits\" in his speech. I have posted a number of times that the Iranian Nuclear Deal which gave Iran 150 billion dollars was a major mistake and this only continues that dangerous reality.

The next primary state is South Carolina where Sanders may struggle with a more diverse demographic as he has not done well with minority voters.

He has expressed concern over the recent major rise in radicalism and discrimination in many parts of Europe against the Jewish people particularly by those of the Islamic faith. All reports indicate that Jewish people in France and Europe have been targeted for hate crimes more than any other group and because of this over the past few years there has been a mass exodus of Jews from Europe to Israel. This movement was accelerated when Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu said he felt \"Europe was not safe for Jews anymore\" because of the rise in radically motivated attacks. Former French president Sarkozy said: \u201cWe do not want French Jews to leave France because they are afraid. We want them to be comfortable to practice. We must stand up to protect our Jewish communities. It is impossible not to. We did not fight the Nazis to force the Jews to run to Israel\". These are strong words by the French president and they shed light on a growing problem, the inability for many immigrants to assimilate to Western culture.

According to The Daily Caller, both retreats will take place from Friday to Sunday, during which time white attendees will learn about concepts such as \u201cwhite privilege,\u201d \u201cmicroaggressions,\u201d and \u201cinstitutional racism,\u201d while the retreat for non-white students will also focus on \u201c[empowering] students of color.\u201d What are your thoughts on this plan to help \"build racial tolerance\" by the Oregon State Office of Diversity and Cultural Engagement?
