Check in with your body and see where you're feeling a little creaky or tense, then stretch it out.\nOnce you finish stretching, snap a photo of your lovable self in the stretching pose that felt best to you, looking just as you did when you woke up.\n\nRemember, bedhead, zits, and morning dragon breath are things we all have in common, so don't be afraid.

It\u2019s a vicious cycle, and I\u2019ve learned that it gets harder to break it the longer I allow it to continue.\n.\nI\u2019ve been working hard for the last week to break the crappy cycle I\u2019ve been stuck in. I\u2019m focused on my sleep, my nutrition, my physical activity level, and I\u2019ve spent some nourishing time with good friends.\n.\nIt usually takes a few days of forcing myself, no matter how hard it feels, to just get up and do the things I know I should do. One baby step at a time.\n.\nIt can be a struggle, but, usually soon after, I\u2019m rewarded with a day like today.\n.\nI woke up this morning with a smile that I\u2019ve been able to maintain all day long, even when tested, and I\u2019m still shining.\n.\nI find myself remembering how to laugh in the face of life\u2019s obstacles again, rather than letting each one be the straw that breaks this camels back.\n.\nI know it can be easy to get overwhelmed when you\u2019re feeling low, and maybe even forget that there REALLY IS a bright light waiting for you at the end of the tunnel.\n.\nIf that\u2019s happening to you right now, I\u2019m here to remind you, from my own experience, that just because you\u2019re having a bad day, week, month, or year, doesn\u2019t mean you have a bad life.\n.\nHang in there, and be extra loving to yourself, because you deserve it.

Exactly how much I would dread it, believe it or not, was in direct proportion to how GOOD my year had been. Sound weird? I know, but let me explain. \ud83d\ude09\nGratefully, for most of my life, each year has been better than the last; and yet at the end of each year, I would become afraid that it had been my best year. The reason I was afraid was because I couldn\u2019t conceive of how I could have a better year than the one I just had. \ud83d\ude31\nWhat if my luck had run out? What if it\u2019s all down hill from here? The next year was definitely not going to be as good. I was convinced. \ud83d\ude45\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\nAs you can imagine, NYE was a depressing holiday for me, and even if I was at a party, I\u2019d usually sneak to the bathroom for a good cry at some point. \ud83d\ude2d\nThis year though, it\u2019s different. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\nIt\u2019s not that I\u2019ve had a bad year, and it\u2019s only up from here. Not at all. Apart from some seriously challenging moments, all and all I\u2019ve had another great year, but this year, on this day, I\u2019m no longer afraid. \ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffb\nThis year, I have more faith in myself than ever before. I don\u2019t feel that life is happening to me, while I rely on luck, and that next year my luck might run out. \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb\nThis year, I know that I make my own luck. Because after all, luck is where preparation meets opportunity, and consider me prepared to make next year an epic year for the books. \u26a1\ufe0f\nI know it\u2019s easy to go down the rabbit hole today. Whether it\u2019s being overly critical of the year behind you, or fearful of the year ahead\u2014 I challenge you, this year, to stop that cycle. \u270b\ud83c\udffb\nIf you\u2019re having trouble stopping it, I get it. I\u2019ve been there and might be again in the future, who knows? But take it from me: no matter what happened this year, you have the power to make next year whatever you want it to be. \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb\n.\n\ud83d\udcf8: @lifeinabeachtown"}, {"date": "2013-04-24T16:27:23.000Z", "comments": 25, "tags": [], "likes": 803, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/b3e32763b0890268fac54b2af049b515/5B6FFA74/t51.2885-15/e15/12501861_948279265267268_1192897707_n.jpg", "description": "Good morning from me and my dog Neila! Last night I put up a photo of a coat that I wanted to win, and I got some very nasty reactions from some of you.\nTo those of you going out of your way to be negative and posting on my page to tell me that I'm \"not a true yogi\" or that I'm an \"animal killer\" ... Google Ahimsa and try practicing it yourself.\n\nI have nothing but respect for all the vegans out there, however, I am not a vegan. I wish that all of the haters from last night (who also all happen to be vegan), would have the same attitude and the same respect for me and my views, although I choose not to be vegan. Dear nasty vegans (just to clarify, nice vegans are awesome), and anyone else who thinks that your sh*t doesn't stink... Please get over yourselves, because yours stinks too.\n\nThis brings me to another point of contention. The nasty vegans from last night brought this to mind, but they aren't by any means the only ones guilty of it. People, yes yogis I'm talking to you too, please stop being so negative and judgmental to the people in your life, including me.\n\nIf you have a negative comment to make, do yourself and everyone around you a favor, (again including me), and consider keeping it to yourself next time. What do you achieve by being so negative? Did it make you feel better about yourself to call me an animal killer? Why is that?\n\nJudge yourself before you judge others, although for your sake, I hope that you aren't as harsh on yourselves as you were on me. Give the people in your life a break today, and say something nice instead.\nHave an awesome day yogis! \u2764"}, {"date": "2016-07-06T17:28:30.000Z", "comments": 25, "tags": [], "likes": 3179, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/4f431c7465cea82114c6bfc1c09aa7c8/5B520FBC/t51.2885-15/e35/13531927_1750597278559356_233229434_n.jpg", "description": "I wrote an epic caption to go with this photo.

I'm finally coming back to life! 2016 has been the rockiest start of any year yet, complete with being stranded and an insane stomach virus, but I'm actually feeling really positive.\n.\nUntil yesterday, I was so sick that I couldn't move. It was AWFUL. I'm pretty sure it was also a wake up call from the universe that I needed to rest. REALLY REST. I had burned the candle at both ends for too long and it took a big toll on my immune system.\n.\nHere's what's making me feel positive though: I'm SO grateful for this entire 2016 experience so far. While being stranded, sick, and forced to rest may have been painful and challenging, it gave me a chance to start the year with an epic realization.\n.\nRest and free time are SO important, and I haven't given myself enough of either. For months, \"free time\" has meant catching up on emails, social media, and texting, while also trying to actually enjoy whatever my free time activity was (friends, reading, tv, etc.).\n.\nI was multi-tasking so much that I didn't enjoy my free time. I felt like, no matter what, I never had enough time in the day to simply enjoy myself and wind down. Then I'd stay up too late, trying to make the day last a little longer and find time to give myself a break.\n.\nThe next day I'd wake up tired, and the cycle would continue. It's not a sustainable way to live, and I really see that now. Hello work-life balance!\n.\nThe best part? I was so afraid to really let go EVER, and now I've been forced to for about a week, and my world didn't end. Instead, it got better.\n.\nI was weak, so I had to zero in on my priorities and be as efficient as possible with my energy. As I practiced this, I inadvertently re-tapped the well of motivation and energy I had been missing for months. Plus, when I view it all through fresh eyes, my social media and emails don't actually take that long if I really sit down and focus.\n.\nMy real New Years resolution came about 9 days late, and it is this: In 2016 I will love myself unconditionally and maintain a sustainable work-life balance. 2016 is already shaping up to be a HUGE year, and I'm going to need all the energy I can... to stop and enjoy it all along the way. \u270c\ud83c\udffb\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude09"}, {"date": "2018-01-06T03:41:27.000Z", "comments": 25, "tags": [], "likes": 11406, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/6acfca38f4be1cb0cdead335debb6b52/5B6E4C3E/t51.2885-15/e35/26070387_585911898425652_8010718493622140928_n.jpg", "description": "They say never to ask a woman her age, and for the most part, it\u2019s an old adage that I adhere to. \ud83d\ude4a\nI rarely ask other women their ages, and I find that, except when they\u2019re under the age of 25 (a.k.a. still excited to discuss their age), other women rarely ask me. \ud83e\udd10\nI guess I\u2019ve been feeling a little old lately.

I want to save money and stop being 20 minutes late (on the low end \ud83d\ude2c) wherever I go, but to do so, I will have to overcome my fear of public transportation, which really means overcoming the issues that riding the subway shines a light on. \ud83d\udca1\nIt means that I\u2019ll have to get comfortable with being closely surrounded by lots of people.

Things are falling into place in a magical way, and I\u2019m feeling so grateful, so this sudden self doubt feels out of place. Does this ever happen to you? \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n.\nI was talking to my roommate @ianahealey about it, and he gave me a good trick to use in these moments. He has a name for the self doubt I woke up with: \u201cThe What-If Game\u201d, and I had been playing a negative What-If Game. \ud83d\ude24\n.\n\u201cWhat if things are about to stop going my way?\u201d\n\u201cWhat if I was wrong, and things actually aren\u2019t even going my way at all?\u201d\n\u201cWhat if I got excited too quickly about new opportunities and they end up falling through?\u201d \ud83d\ude27\n.\nI know that these doubts are baseless for the most part, but it didn\u2019t stop them from being present this morning. Then @ianahealey suggested I try playing a positive What-If Game. \ud83d\udca1\n.\n\u201cWhat if things keep going my way?\u201d\n\u201cWhat if I\u2019m right, and things really are aligning the way I\u2019ve wanted them to?\u201d\n\u201cWhat if all of these opportunities come through, and then even more arise?\u201d \ud83d\ude03\n.\nThese positive What-If questions and the likelihood of their outcomes are just as likely as the negative What-Ifs...probably even more so honestly. So why are many of us so quick to go down a negative What-If rabbit hole? \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n.\nIt\u2019s easy to forget that we each really do have the power to shift our focus and amend our thinking on any issue, at anytime. Your mind is strong, but YOU are stronger! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffb\n.\nSo the next time you find yourself falling down a negative What-If Game spiral, I challenge you to flip your script. Make it a positive What-If Game, and see how this impacts your experience. \ud83d\udd2e\n.\nIt\u2019s been a game changer for my morning today, and I imagine it will be for many more to come. Hope it helps you too. \ud83d\udc97\n.\n\ud83d\udcf8: @aubrymarie // @aloyoga "}, {"date": "2014-06-06T22:42:02.000Z", "comments": 25, "tags": [], "likes": 5117, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/f567eb185a7eb508e34d620293f64d55/5B6626DF/t51.2885-15/e15/12724702_1179633898727130_2138541937_n.jpg", "description": "In honor of National Donut Day, here is my best donut shape.

Does practicing this pose, and other hip opening poses, make you feel angry or sad?\nWe tend to hold the tension from our repressed emotions in our hips. Sometimes practicing hip opening poses like this one can trigger a release of those repressed emotions.\n\nRather than avoiding hip opening poses, because they make you feel angry or sad, relish the chance to become aware of what you need to let go.\n\nWhen you have a strong emotional reaction to any pose, don't let your emotions have the final say. Treat this experience as a beautiful opportunity that your body has given you, to become aware and to look within and analyze how you are truly experiencing your life.\n\nOur emotions and experiences are a backpack that we constantly carry. It's good to have them around for when we need them. If we keep shoving emotions and experiences that don't serve us to the bottom of the bag instead of letting them go, the backpack becomes too heavy to carry.\nDon't let your metaphorical backpack slow you down. In letting go of whatever doesn't serve us, we achieve freedom and a quality of lightness that is a precursor to joy.\n\nBe light. Be bright. Be happy.\n\nLet it happen. Let it be.

I'd \"accidentally\" \ud83d\ude09miss flights, in order to stay a few extra days without having to admit how much I was avoiding my real life.\nLately I've challenged myself to make decisions differently. I step out of my comfort zone every chance I get, and rather than running away, I run toward the things I'm afraid of.\nFor awhile, I wondered if making these difficult decisions was even worth it. I wondered if I would ever feel truly capable of dealing with life's trials and tribulations, or if they would continue to break me down at almost every turn. Was any of this even working?\nI never really know the answers to these sorts of questions until I'm tested, and that is definitely happening right now.\nIn the time since I arrived in Greece, I've had a scary and disappointing health wake up call, had both my house and my car broken into back in LA, and shattered my phone beyond repair.\nBut here's how I know I've changed my life: before, with all of this on my plate, I would have avoided going home like the plague. I probably would have missed at least 3 flights. \ud83d\ude09\nHowever, even with the mountain of shit waiting for me, I can't wait to get back. I'm consistently letting go of the people, places, and things that no longer serve me, which is still scary, but I'm being rewarded.\nAll of this has created a lot of space, and so far I've filled that space by finding the love of my life and attracting an abundance of exciting new opportunities... and now those are waiting for me too.\nThis wealth of both pain and joy, has taught me a very valuable lesson: unexpected life events, that are out of my control, will never stop happening, because that's simply the nature of life. But, as long as I control the things I CAN control, and fill my life with enough joy to sustain me through life's tests, then nothing, and I mean nothing, will be able to break me.\nIf you're struggling, hang in there. Control the things you can control, and make the space to fill with joy. Even if you don't have any notion of where you'll find that joy, make the space anyway and the joy will find you.

I want to add something to your day, whether that means teaching you something, letting you see you aren\u2019t alone, reminding you how lovable and enough you are, or simply making you feel something. \ud83d\udc97\nSharing for the sake of sharing doesn\u2019t light my fire, but sharing with a purpose does. Sometimes that purpose gets lost, and I need a break to find it again. I found it this morning. \ud83d\udd25\nOf all of my realizations over the last 7 days, perhaps the most beneficial are these 2 nuggets:\n-Take breaks to stoke and reignite your fire when you need to. Better to show up to your daily life with joy and energy than with dread and fatigue. \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb\n-Ask yourself this question the next time you go to post on IG or any other social media: what is my intention for posting this right now? \ud83e\udd14\nThere\u2019s no right or wrong or better or worse answer, but I find it to be a helpful question to build awareness around how and why we are all here together on this platform. \ud83d\udc4b\ud83c\udffb\nI asked myself that question, and this post is what came out of it. \ud83d\udc97 "}, {"date": "2016-12-03T01:00:16.000Z", "comments": 25, "tags": ["#beagoddess", "#yoga"], "likes": 4229, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/0c3fd533c61e474dfef51f5b84ba4845/5B5D264E/t51.2885-15/e35/15043792_131369704015051_2352591945819226112_n.jpg", "description": "Good things they are a coming.

You might not feel that coming from my posts, but it's usually there lurking behind the scenes.\n\nFor a long time I felt stifled and sometimes even paralyzed by it. Practicing yoga has helped me learn to manage my anxiety, but it hasn't taught me to overcome it.\n\nHowever, I had the realization yesterday that I've turned a new page in my anxiety journey.\nIn the past, I would meet new people and be so nervous that I would clam up and become inauthentic, trying too hard to make people love and accept me. So, as a result I kept meeting new people to a minimum.\nEnter social media, mainly Instagram. This beautiful medium of connection has changed my life.\nThrough Instagram, I've found the courage to meet and deeply connect with more people than I could ever have imagined. I went to 2 meetings yesterday, and they were both turned out awesome.\n\nI headed to each one telling myself my same old story: \"you're going to get shy, act like a weirdo, and screw this up.\" What a lame way to talk to myself.\n\nThen I went to both meetings and did not get shy, did not act like a weirdo, and did not screw anything up. This brings me to my realization: I may have been afraid to meet new people and felt paralyzed by social anxiety in the past, but that's an old story. It's no longer true.\n\nIn reality, I'm not shy anymore, and I'm definitely not paralyzed. I am a weirdo, but in a good way, and I love my quirks. In this photo from yesterday, I'm jumping for joy with Crissy from @chintwins.\n\nDo I look shy? Or weird? Or like a screw up? Nope. I look happy, and I feel happy too.\n\nWhat stories do you tell yourself about the way you interact with the world? Are they true? You just might find, as I have, that some of your negative stories of the past deserve a present and positive update.\nLive in the present, and give yourself credit for the self-work that you are doing. Keep working, keep improving, keep believing. Then one day you might just wake up and realize you have a new and positive story to tell yourself. \u270c\ufe0f"}, {"date": "2013-11-28T18:21:26.000Z", "comments": 25, "tags": [], "likes": 2796, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/2e1c221e53db8c8bfbea74d879911504/5ADD21C2/t51.2885-15/e15/12905143_998399133579058_734876999_n.jpg", "description": "Happy Turkey Day!\nThis is how my epic fail video from yesterday was supposed to turn out, before I completely flipped out of my headstand.\nIf you fall down, just get back up and try again.

I've never actually met her, but she managed to turn my whole day around today, and I want to thank her.\n\nI'll just let the cat out of the bag: My relationship of the last 3 years has ended. It's mutual and we are going to stay friends, thank goodness, but I've been having good days and bad days nonetheless. I'm doing okay, but it's also been an emotionally challenging experience, so every bit of extra love and understanding helps.\n\nThis morning was not a good one. I was crying, and I didn't want to be crying anymore, so I decided to distract myself by checking my email (totally post-modern coping mechanism lol). The first one I opened was from @charlottetheyogi, and her email couldn't possibly have come to me at a more perfect time. I won't tell you what she wrote, that's between us, but I will tell you that by the end of her email, there were a lot of happy tears being mixed in and slowly crowding out the sad tears rolling down my cheeks.\n\nEven though we've never even met, Charlotte took the time to write and send me a really meaningful message that impacted my whole day. She didn't owe me, a total stranger, any kind words or friendship, but she shared her love and shined her light on me anyway.\n\nYou never know what someone else is going through, and sometimes kind words to a stranger can change their day, week, month, or year. You could save a life with a timely compliment or smile, and never even know it.\n\nThank you Charlotte for your kind words and encouragement. I needed them. At one point, you wrote that I probably wouldn't see your email, but that it was worth it to you to send anyway. Well, I saw it, and I am truly grateful to you and inspired by your selfless kindness and love for someone you've never even met.\n\nLike Charlotte did for me, without even knowing it, you have the power to change someone's sad tears to happy ones in the space of a simple act of kindness.\n\nSo go out there today, with Charlotte as your inspiration, and pay the love and kindness forward. Maybe go show @charlottetheyogi some love too. She's awesome and she deserves it. \ud83d\ude09\u2764\ufe0f"}, {"date": "2013-07-29T23:44:14.000Z", "comments": 25, "tags": [], "likes": 3180, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/8e7650120a3532ee481a611a57599522/5B5B7A75/t51.2885-15/e15/12724611_1124393417603389_1469662988_n.jpg", "description": "One last gem from my visit to the beautiful and colorful island of Burano. \u2764\ud83d\ude03\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf9"}, {"date": "2016-02-04T23:00:15.000Z", "comments": 25, "tags": ["#tbt"], "likes": 27162, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/6c0d8e3de31a66a40b153657c2143630/5ADCCBFE/t51.2885-15/e15/12424780_1727997890769748_1528138294_n.jpg", "description": ""}, {"date": "2014-09-26T01:36:05.000Z", "comments": 25, "tags": [], "likes": 2617, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/d032ff06b8879f06fd2e0d230eaf574a/5B6DA054/t51.2885-15/e15/12905223_239013623118483_1355082312_n.jpg", "description": "Happiness comes from within.

I shared a genuine smile with each person whose eyes I connected with.\nIt was interesting to watch how different people reacted to this simple gesture of eye contact and a smile that meant \"I see you and you are loved\". When I smiled, some looked down or away, unable to let my smile in. Others gave me a really shy half smile back that seemed to say \"I want to smile, but I'm afraid. I'm trying.\" The people who made me happiest were those who smiled back. Openly smiled back. Many of them looked like they had really needed that smiling moment with a stranger.\nI could see the moment when they realized my smile was meant for them, followed by the moment when they decided to accept it and smile back, to connect with me.\n\nThen a few people actually beat me to it. They smiled at me first. I accepted their smiles, grateful, and shared my own in return.\n\nI always want to experience deeper connections, and this is one more way to practice being open to shared moments and connection...even if it's only for a couple seconds with a stranger walking past.\n\nI challenge you to give this practice a try today. It's really simple. Look at the people you pass by throughout your day. Really see them.

I've noticed that he is very vocal on Instagram, about this being his signature pose.\nIn this crazy global world of social media that we live in, posts can easily go viral. In the case of @nightmaretales pose, I've seen it popping up all over Instagram.\n\nI'm curious how all of you feel about claiming ownership of poses. How far does it go?\nIn my experience, once something goes viral, it's almost impossible to control who posts it and whether they credit the source.\n\nI struggle with this now and then with my photos, and with the hash tags of the challenges that I host. I can't control who hash tags their photos with the challenge hash tag...and sometimes we get some really random tags.\nI'm often tempted to want to try to control who uses the challenge hash tag. I've tried a few times, but my efforts were fruitless.\nI realize time and again, that once the challenge hash tag has gone viral, there's not a lot I can do. I feel for @nightmaretales, he created a really cool pose that is an awesome stretch and sensation.\nThis whole conversation also makes me think of the frequent court cases involving ownership of the Bikram Yoga sequence.\n\nSo, my question for all of you is this: how far do you think ownership of a pose or sequence goes?\nI'm interested to hear your opinions on this topic. Please keep the conversation friendly and respectful.\n\nPractice love in all that you do. \u2764"}, {"date": "2013-06-18T16:42:18.000Z", "comments": 25, "tags": ["#YogaInSpace"], "likes": 1374, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/c861fd8e61c6b94583fc98a3611444ec/5B5FAB54/t51.2885-15/e15/12383255_1699142993690905_1744882040_n.jpg", "description": "I LOVE flipping my grip in bow pose.

This is big.\n\nIt all started when I put up a video of me practicing yoga this morning. I got a lot of beautiful comments, which I am very grateful for, but I also got some comments that made me very sad.\n\nIf you have been following me for a while, then you know that it really ticks me off people leave me comments telling me I'm too skinny, or that I need to \"eat a cheeseburger\". Comments like those make me sad and shake my confidence. I try not to let them, but sometimes I fail. I've always thought the problem was with the people leaving the comments. If only they would choose love instead of hate.\n\nToday I realized the problem is with me. If I truly loved myself as much as I always say I do, these comments wouldn't even phase me. We can't change others' behavior, but we are all capable of changing the way that we react to it.\n\nInstead of letting these comments get me down and discourage me, from now on I'm choosing to use them as motivation to love myself even more than I already do.\nThank you to all the haters for leading me to this realization. This experience has given me a newfound awareness that loving myself is a never-ending practice, one that must always be diligent about; especially in the face of negativity.\n\nNow I will go back to enjoying the biggest strawberry margarita ever.

From one goddess to another, that's a bad bitch move.\" \ud83d\ude00\nI left there feeling like a bad bitch in the best possible way, with an unexpected and newfound responsibility and drive to live up to this tattoo, this new mantra if you will. \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffb\nEvery time I see it, it's a reminder to say yes to life, not to make assumptions about others' thoughts and opinions, and to always proudly own the fact that I AM A GODDESS. \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb\nTo my goddesses and my bad bitches, from one to another, I see you, and I want you to always remember who and what you are. \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udd25\nTag someone who could use a reminder. \ud83d\udc97\n.\n\ud83d\udcf8: @mikiash\n\ud83d\udc8d\ud83d\udc57: @loganhollowelljewelry @whitefoxboutique"}, {"date": "2015-12-06T20:47:39.000Z", "comments": 25, "tags": ["#MayTheWeekendContinue"], "likes": 3412, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/14488ad6b29c12ebb5475dffe05b6c4b/5B5F9150/t51.2885-15/e35/12935013_695093073927442_1339012684_n.jpg", "description": "I woke up a few minutes ago thinking today was Monday...and that I had slept in wayyyyy too late.

Too much rumination, and too little action, gave me time to create an intimidating laundry list of doubts and insecurities before I even started. I let fear of possible outcomes, and others opinions, paralyze me until I became afraid to try anything, and the list of doubts seemed never ending. Unfortunately, if fear of failure stops you from trying, it also stops you from succeeding.\n\nWell, I'm over it. Perfection and too much care for the opinions of others are major buzzkills. I'm tired of being afraid to ruffle feathers, when a little feather ruffling sometimes can be a valuable experience for everyone involved to know themselves more deeply.\n\nI'm tired of holding in my opinions and holding back parts of who I am for fear of judgment from haters and holier-than-thou wannabe yogis (yes, if you are one of those Uber-judgey people who thinks it's okay to be that way because you're \"a yogi\", then you heard me correctly, I did indeed just call you a wannabe yogi.) I'm not a perfect yogi by any stretch. In fact, I've ceased to identify myself as a yogi, because I find there's too much dogma around that word these days, and there is SO MUCH more to me than my yoga practice.\n\nMy breakthrough today came when I realized that those I was afraid of, the haters and holier-than-thou judges, are not, and simply never will be, my people. I don't need their love or acceptance. I need more of this. More posts like this.\n\nJoin me in being imperfect and reveling in the beauty of it. Let's be real. Let's be messy.

Before that I was teaching A LOT, like 17 classes a week.\n\nIn the interim, I had an experience at a teacher training that traumatized me and convinced me I was a horrible yoga teacher. I literally felt like I was doing my students a disservice by calling myself a teacher.\n\nMy fear and insecurity overtook me and I stopped teaching large classes. My confidence was gone and I didn't feel good enough to stand at the front of that room.\n\nDuring the last 3 years, I've taught online, led private sessions, hosted a retreat, and even filmed my own yoga TV show where I taught, but no large classes, because I was too afraid to teach a class with a real live students in front of me.. Well, now that's no longer true.\n\nWhen one of my best friends @caleyalyssa's yoga teacher sub cancelled last minute, I had the choice to step up or let my friend down when she was in a bind. So I stepped up (amidst tears, trembling, and almost paralyzing fear of not being good enough). She found a sub after that and gave me the chance to let myself off he hook, but I refused. It was time to put this to bed once and for all. I was tired of carrying this heavy bag of fear and insecurity around with me.\n\nCarrying my fear with me still, I went in there and ROCKED IT. Once I got into my groove, everything felt natural again and I wasn't scared. It was familiar and it felt like a sort of home. All that fear, all that insecurity, FOR YEARS!, and in the space of a leap of faith and a 75 minute yoga class, I found my confidence again.\nI now have a new story to replace the old one: NOT ONLY AM I GOOD ENOUGH, BUT I AM A GREAT YOGA TEACHER! \ud83d\ude03 "}, {"date": "2013-09-28T00:05:59.000Z", "comments": 25, "tags": [], "likes": 2188, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/be2d3b0fb4e5172053472da4d4c36dc3/5ADCA9FD/t51.2885-15/e15/12530669_1521186864857152_95131936_n.jpg", "description": "Because sometimes sunsets are worth clapping for..."}, {"date": "2015-08-01T22:17:49.000Z", "comments": 25, "tags": ["#yoga", "#gypsetgoddess"], "likes": 3101, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/c9316839251aa14c8ebe4876b85d911f/5B55BD63/t51.2885-15/e35/11205843_516465171894147_1299638758_n.jpg", "description": "Then I found peace in a field of flowers... \u270c\ud83c\udffb\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\ud83c\udf3c\n-\n\ud83d\udcf7: @sp__cecase -\n"}, {"date": "2014-11-11T20:08:39.000Z", "comments": 25, "tags": [], "likes": 3837, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/b8ab1470b4bb4c69ca8147856eb2f1c1/5B76F2F6/t51.2885-15/e15/12445786_619933101504629_1818382265_n.jpg", "description": "Straight chillin. \u2600\ufe0f\ud83d\ude03 @fsborabora"}, {"date": "2017-09-28T16:26:03.000Z", "comments": 25, "tags": ["#beagoddess"], "likes": 20247, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/f00f1ebba27840c9e5ed2696b2393b75/5ADCC5F8/t51.2885-15/e15/21980375_2021301448100919_3385503727644311552_n.jpg", "description": "When things are up and down, you can either fight against the natural rhythm of things, attempting to swim upstream, or you can surrender and just go with the flow.

I had to shoot this photo several times, because each time there were alignment issues that I hadn't expected.\n\nBefore seeing some of my out takes, I believed that my chaturanga was flawless. Overconfident much Caitlin? LOL.\nI have practiced for years to refine my alignment in this pose, and I thought that I had \"conquered\" chaturanga.\nIn the end, I got the photo that I was hoping for, but this whole experience was a wonderful reminder that no matter how hard I try, I can never and will never be able to \"conquer\" my yoga practice.\nFurthermore, why would I want to? When there is nothing left to learn and no room to grow, life can feel empty, boring, pointless.\n\nEven though my ego may want to \"conquer\" yoga, that would take all the fun out of it. I am happy to keep learning and practicing. When all is known, the magic is gone...and I love magic.\n\nKeep the magic in your practice, even if it means sometimes recognizing that there is room to improve. \u270c"}, {"date": "2016-08-25T02:43:30.000Z", "comments": 25, "tags": [], "likes": 4313, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/53dee7d97755a6cce2e2e41fd418f5cc/5B6E03F7/t51.2885-15/e35/14027275_1772229846322024_2074823278_n.jpg", "description": "That sunset though! \u2600\ufe0f\u2728\ud83c\udf19"}, {"date": "2013-06-28T00:50:08.000Z", "comments": 25, "tags": [], "likes": 2896, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/f20f71b9bf9f2ef4b4f29e3c8202e76d/5B6C1432/t51.2885-15/e15/12940893_518048168374706_84895037_n.jpg", "description": "One of the best savasana moments that I've ever experienced.\nWhen I posted my last photo, a lot of you expressed that you would love to ride an elephant too.

He was our guide as we toured Robben Island, the island prison where Nelson Mandela served the majority of his prison sentence.\n-\nTom served 11 and a half years of a 12 year sentence as a political prisoner in this same prison. One would think that after all of the time and hardship inside these walls, this would be the last place that he would ever want to return to.\n-\nYet here he is, coming back several days a week as a guide, to share his stories and educate people like me on the inequalities and injustices that still exist in our world...as much as they are easy to forget in my comfortable, coddled, equal, and freedom-filled American life.\n-\nThe most profound moment of this entire trip occurred during a conversation that I had with Tom. He told me that when he was released, he had fully forgiven his captors and the system of injustice and inequality that had landed him there in first place, for joining the movement to rebel against it.\n-\nI asked him how he found the power within him to forgive. His answer not only inspired me, but I felt it in my heart and my soul. It gave me chills. The kind of chills where the hair on my arms stands at attention, knowing that a profound moment is occurring.\n-\nTom told me he knew that he must forgive fully, from his heart and his soul, for the sake of the country he loves. He explained that he, and the other leaders and members of the movement, knew that if they left prison carrying anger and hate with them, then that is the direction that they would lead the future of South Africa.\n-\nTom and the others knew that they must lead and live from love, not hate, even if it meant truly forgiving the unforgivable, because they believed in their cause so wholeheartedly.\n-\nHowever, there was another, deeper, reason that Tom felt it necessary to forgive: because he knew that until he did, he would never truly be free. NOW THAT IS SERIOUSLY PROFOUND.\n-\nAfter our conversation, I will always remember that true freedom can be found often only in forgiveness. \u270c\ud83c\udffb\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\ud83c\uddff\ud83c\udde6 "}, {"date": "2013-12-04T14:25:49.000Z", "comments": 25, "tags": [], "likes": 6783, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/f217b47c69b5837b80ff4f58f2377259/5B776695/t51.2885-15/e15/12105005_601815606640608_1491472395_n.jpg", "description": "Good morning.

It gave me the chance to portray myself as a person that I thought everyone would like and love, even more than they liked and loved the real me.\n.\nAs a person who has had many moments of wanting to be someone else, this ability to control how people saw me became intoxicating for a time.\n.\nWhere I was weak, Gypset Goddess was strong. Where I was afraid, Gypset Goddess was fearless. Where I felt not good enough, Gypset Goddess always was.\n.\nIt\u2019s true, people do like and love Gypset Goddess, but the funny thing is that they never have ended up liking or loving her more than they do me.\n.\nWhen I would meet people who followed Gypset Goddess before they met me, their response 9 out of 10 times used to be this: you\u2019re a lot cooler than I thought you would be.\n.\nFor awhile this surprised me. How could they possibly like me better than Gypset Goddess (aka the better version of me)?\n.\nThis kept happening until it dawned on me: Gypset Goddess was near perfect, and perfection is both unrelatable and boring. I thought that I needed to seem more \u201cperfect\u201d to be more likeable and loveable, but in fact, seeming more perfect made me less of both.\n.\nI decided to drop the facade and bring more of myself into my persona until they became one and the same.

I say \"practice\", because often I was filming sequences for the purpose of posting them, not actually filming my home practice (which had become dormant).\nIt came to a head one day earlier this year, when, feeling pressure to come up with an engaging sequence, and choosing one that was ridiculously and needlessly complex for the purpose of getting more views, I literally found myself flipping off my yoga mat, because I was frustrated that I messed up the sequence I was trying to film, for what felt like the 50th time.\nUnfortunately I have this on video, and maybe one day I'll share it as a cautionary tale. Suffice to say, I've been on a yoga video break since that day, and I was determined not to make or share another video until I was actually filming my yoga practice (not \"practice\") again.\nI even stopped referring to myself as a yogi. I felt like a fake, and I was constantly worried that my fake image would shatter, and you would all find I wasn't practicing yoga as deeply as I sometimes made it seem.\nWell, now I guess I've shattered that image myself, and it actually feels pretty great. There's a freedom in saying \"fuck it\" and sharing the things you feel most ashamed of.\nFor a while, I didn't know how to start being real again, because when your entire life has become filtered and curated, it's hard to peel those layers back...and it's scary to admit it when you haven't been being your most authentic self.\nSo I'll just start here, with this caption, a return to my home practice, and a return to the videos that built this page.\nI feel peace and playfulness in my practice again, and in admitting all of this right here right now, in sharing my shame with you, I'm already starting to feel a lot more like a yogi again. \ud83d\udc97"}, {"date": "2015-11-01T07:22:05.000Z", "comments": 19, "tags": [], "likes": 3284, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/1052977638eef0fc1ba44b50418106d7/5B550510/t51.2885-15/e35/12080439_1022805181146903_1042510459_n.jpg", "description": "Greetings.

Always expecting them to at best talk behind my back, and at worst stab me in it.\n.\nOne of the biggest steps out of my comfort zone to date, has been to start trusting women to be my friends again, but it's a constant and sometimes difficult practice.\n.\nI had built up a wall to protect myself from unexpected betrayal and hurt feelings for so long, that even now I still sometimes notice the old automatic assumption popping up: that other women don't like me and that they are potentially planning to do something awful to me.\n.\nViewing the world through that particular lens, you can probably imagine what I see, even if it isn't always actually there. Through that lens, other women need to be feared, as if they all have hidden backstabbing knives ready to use at any moment.\n.\nThe hardest thing about feeling betrayed and living in the fear of betrayal, is that it forces you to sit back and question your own judgment at the end of the day. You thought that person was safe and trustworthy, but you were wrong, and then they hurt you. What now?\n.\nBut then I started a new practice. Rather than living in fear, I actively decide to trust myself and others. Not the hippie \"trust the universe\" kind of trust, but a calculated and adult trust.\n.\nI've grown up now. I've learned to read people, recognize patterns, know myself, know the type of people I want close to me, and the type that I don't.\n.\nThrough my new lens, I can see that the story I had told myself for so long, that women automatically hated me on site, is not and was never a true story. Turns out women can be incredible and supportive friends.\n.\nI share this with you, because all too often, we carry stories with us that we see as truths, even after they cease to be true... or never were true in the first place.\n.\nCheck in with your stories, and see if you've moved beyond any of them (I bet you have!!). Maybe it's time to let one go. \ud83d\udc97\n.\n\ud83d\udcf8: @mikiash\n\ud83d\udc6f: @caleyalyssa"}, {"date": "2016-03-28T16:59:27.000Z", "comments": 25, "tags": [], "likes": 2585, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/5fb141124fa716837ac0cb82a7879a6f/5B69FC5D/t51.2885-15/e35/12959960_155014554893673_1029404908_n.jpg", "description": "Hope you're starting your week feeling like a yogi badass with a little gangster rapper thrown into your vibe. \ud83d\ude09\n-\n\ud83d\udcf7: @oneoeight.tv"}, {"date": "2017-09-22T16:10:28.000Z", "comments": 25, "tags": ["#beagoddess"], "likes": 48810, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/c5f838b71b6e3b3886e9ec6aa5afa08b/5ADCF9E7/t51.2885-15/e15/21910701_488542788186305_8059160278702489600_n.jpg", "description": "In case you ever wondered how I look when I'm over the moon happy... now you know. \ud83d\ude0d "}, {"date": "2014-10-07T22:34:14.000Z", "comments": 25, "tags": ["#nostretchypants"], "likes": 3485, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/1027f26fa5264b4619df47369e3ba0e8/5B7784B1/t51.2885-15/e15/12519563_214499348921071_967165013_n.jpg", "description": "Do you recognize me without yoga pants on?

My realization came during a yoga class that I went to this morning.\nThere was a girl practicing next to me, who insisted on practicing handstands, out of sequence, for basically the entire 75 minutes of class.\nWhile the whole class was winding down in pigeon poses and forward folds, she was still handstanding all over the place, dropping down into wheel or chaturanga and being REALLY loud about the whole thing. No soft landings here. Boom! Pow! She was distracting, and she was driving me crazy. Crazy, I tell you.\nBut here's what I realized. She wasn't driving me crazy. I was letting myself be driven crazy. It wasn't even about her, it was about me and the fact that I woke up on the wrong side of the bed.\nOnce I took a breath and checked myself, I realized I was being unfair. Who am I to judge the way that she was enjoying a yoga class that I chose to attend?\nInstead, I focused on my breathing. The sound, the feeling, the experience of breathing, of being alive. I thought \"there's so much in the world to be grateful for and happy about, and there isn't time to waste judging others.\" Right around the time I had this thought, I realized that I had inadvertently LET IT GO. The anger, the judgment, gone.\n\nIt felt good. I didn't even notice that she was there anymore, because I had switched my focus from the negative to the positive, from the outside to the inside.\nMoments like this make me truly grateful for my yoga practice. Yoga poses are fun and awesome, but the real practice manifests in my everyday life and the way that I relate to the world around me.\nYoga has taught me to breathe through trials and tribulations and to be more compassionate. It's given me the awareness to check myself, on days like today, before I wreck myself.\nTo the handstander who may or may not have seen my eye rolls sent in her direction: I'm sorry for judging you. Your handstand skills are truly impressive and I just woke up on the wrong side of the bed. Thank you for helping me learn a valuable lesson. I am grateful for you... and your handstands. \u270c\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude03"}, {"date": "2013-05-20T22:13:21.000Z", "comments": 14, "tags": ["#maytheforcebewithyogis", "#yoga", "#yogi", "#yogini", "#fun", "#fashion", "#sun", "#fitspo", "#instafit", "#fitstagram", "#fitgirls", "#fitness", "#fit", "#summer", "#motivation", "#sweataday", "#happy", "#me", "#girl", "#instagramfitness", "#fitfam", "#ig", "#igdaily", "#teamnodaysoff", "#gypsetgoddess", "#fitgirls", "#love", "#workout"], "likes": 921, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/cc77d8b35a41a14a5ad5aa9fbba520b0/5B56DAA4/t51.2885-15/e15/12940920_488677697990343_584742888_n.jpg", "description": "Camel pose in the garden. \ud83c\udf33 \ud83c\udf38 "}, {"date": "2013-06-11T01:49:17.000Z", "comments": 25, "tags": ["#Yoga", "#AcroYoga"], "likes": 402, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/ccfd6733c81451014879966ff61c19d8/5B76BB91/t51.2885-15/e15/12934930_1050423521670030_97462355_n.jpg", "description": "\ud83d\udca5INSTAGRAM FAM JAM! \ud83d\udca5\n\nWHEN: Sunday, July 7, 2013\nWHERE: Sheep's Meadow - Central Park in NYC\nTIME: 11am - 1pm \ud83d\udca5\nWe're soooo excited to host a very special "}, {"date": "2018-04-02T23:37:45.000Z", "comments": 25, "tags": [], "likes": 6282, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/dc40f6e517f7a8b6c4a80d388689b421/5B7705A8/t51.2885-15/e35/29716275_167560303902889_7910869592140939264_n.jpg", "description": "I left Arizona 3 years ago following a pretty difficult breakup, and I\u2019ve been scared to come back to visit ever since.

In fact, it\u2019s been just the opposite.\n.\nBeing here has helped me realize that I love the person I am today, so much more than I ever loved the person I used to be.\n.\nYesterday, I stopped avoiding those intersections. Instead, I gave the house a good hard look as I drove by, and to my surprise, I felt... free. The sadness and regret I had feared were nowhere to be found, and it was such a liberating feeling.\n.\nI thought I would come here and be aware of what I didn\u2019t have anymore, but instead I\u2019ve been aware of what I DO have, and that I wouldn\u2019t change a thing.\n.\nFor 3 years, I\u2019ve been missing out on seeing my friends here, and on the chance to allow myself moments of validation, as I see how much I\u2019ve grown since I was here last.\n.\nWell, all of that stops now. I\u2019m not afraid to visit anymore, because in coming here, I\u2019ve been reminded of how much I love this place and the people in it.\n.\nIf there\u2019s a place you\u2019re afraid to visit, because of past experiences there, I urge you to face your fears and go there. Make new memories. Have new experiences. Reclaim that place! Don\u2019t ever let fear of confronting your past, keep you from enjoying your present. \ud83d\udc97\n.\n\ud83d\udcf8: @lifeinabeachtown / @cleobella"}, {"date": "2014-10-15T16:43:14.000Z", "comments": 25, "tags": [], "likes": 3331, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/e4203b62a0a8a5e1b20e0578146bdfb0/5ADCF2D3/t51.2885-15/e15/12479642_1063067870417862_245500401_n.jpg", "description": "Celebrate. Everyday. Today I'm celebrating my first real hand-to-hand!\n\nI've always been so afraid to practice hand-to-hand balancing. Afraid to fall, afraid to get hurt.\n\nA little fear is healthy and natural, it's just part of the human condition and it keeps us safe.\n\nHowever there is a difference between healthy fear and imagined fear. My fear surrounding hand-to-hand was a mix of both.\nI have the skill to practice this, but there is also risk involved. In this case, the skill to risk ratio was less scary in reality than it was in my head.\n\nI know my limits, but I also safely practice leaving my comfort zone sometimes. This helps me feel the whether my fears, surrounding anything, are real and valid or imagined and untrue.\n\nWhat have I learned? I've learned that I have far more imagined fears than valid ones.\nThanks @acrowithjon for helping me rise above my fears. Literally. Also, big thanks to @becksamillion who is killing it on the rings in the background. \ud83d\ude03 Song; \"I Just Want To Celebrate\" by Rare Earth \ud83c\udfb6"}, {"date": "2016-07-18T22:45:10.000Z", "comments": 25, "tags": ["#grateful"], "likes": 5359, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/a92b88e28e90e6a8620df1b2cbdaa851/5B682E9F/t51.2885-15/e35/13767512_752566581552733_1418877098_n.jpg", "description": "Really glad I stayed.

Your lofty goals are attainable, keep pursuing them!\n.\nThere have been lots of ups, downs, and learning experiences (both pleasant and unpleasant) on this weird journey of making it all up as I go, but the one thing that never wavers and never changes is my gratitude for ALL OF YOU.

For me, every AcroYoga experience is a metaphor and a life lesson.\nIn order to fly, you must be able to rise above the fear of trusting another person. It can be scary, but it can also help you grow in leaps and bounds.\nI sometimes have trouble trusting others, so every AcroYoga experience is a scary and rewarding challenge. Even if I fall, then the practice changes from trusting someone not to drop me, to trusting that same person to catch me.\nHere you see me finding freedom in flight, and trusting a complete stranger that I met 10 minutes before this photo was taken. Scary, but also very liberating.\nDo something that scares you today and experience trust, whether that means trusting yourself or trusting someone else. When you rise above your fears, freedom waits on the other side of the experience. \ud83d\ude03\n\nBig thanks to Honza and Claudine of @yogabeyond for first inspiring me to take flight.

Pretty? Cute? Sure. But not sexy.\n.\nI'd go out with my friends and feel like their skinny little sister tagging along. I'd wear \ud83d\udc59 at the beach, but make sure I had a wrap to hide my lack of curves.\n.\nFor years, until recently, I had stopped posting \ud83d\udc59 photos after I got too tired of all of the \"No ass\" and \"You're anorexic\" comments. What's worse is that these comments mostly hurt, because on some level I agreed with them that I looked unhealthy. I felt helpless, because I believed I couldn't change my body and create curves that weren't naturally there.\n.\nThen about 6 months ago, I challenged myself to step up and improve my body and my self image. While I love practicing yoga, my yoga practice alone wasn't helping me to build the muscle I wanted (and, let's be real, the \ud83c\udf51).\n.\nI started strength and resistance training 3x per week with @mrindestructible99, in addition to my yoga, and I'm blown away by the impact that it's had on my body and my self esteem.\n.\nThere have been many days I wanted to cancel, but I force myself to keep going, and tell myself that this is worth the time, energy, and hardship, because the alternative is continuing to feel self conscious and being afraid to wear bikinis.\n.\nWhen I saw this photo for the first time, I thought to myself \"Oh no, you can't post that. It's too sexy.\" That thought stopped me in my tracks, as I was used to the narrative being \"Oh no, you can't post that. You look anorexic.\"\n.\nAnd that's when it hit me: I am succeeding in not only improving my body, but my self image as well. It's moments like this that get me through the days when I want to cancel, and on those days, I remind myself how grateful I am to feel healthy, sexy, capable, and confident.\n.\nThe moral of the story is this: don't ever believe you're stuck with the hand you've been dealt. Love yourself as you are, of course, but if there's something that makes you feel self conscious, love yourself enough to work to improve it. It's certainly not easy to improve things about ourselves, and even harder to change the way we see ourselves, but take it from me, it's always worth the effort. \ud83d\udc97\n.\n\ud83d\udc59: @toripraverswimwear"}, {"date": "2015-04-17T21:01:30.000Z", "comments": 25, "tags": ["#Coachella2015", "#CoachellaNRG", "#sp", "#grateful"], "likes": 3973, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/7010170d94594150a9d0352e915b4f01/5ADD1211/t51.2885-15/e15/12907147_1542024906099301_944868630_n.jpg", "description": "Getting ready for a super fun "}, {"date": "2014-04-22T15:20:19.000Z", "comments": 25, "tags": [], "likes": 4819, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/4a532efef65d4d2520ebbccede38fea5/5ADCDEEC/t51.2885-15/e15/12912566_1160361767308355_91459092_n.jpg", "description": "Happy Earth Day! \ud83c\udf0e\n\nTake a moment to be grateful for the planet we live on and all of the beautiful creatures and plants that we share it with. \u270c\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\ud83c\udf0e"}, {"date": "2016-02-06T22:27:05.000Z", "comments": 25, "tags": ["#beagoddess"], "likes": 37016, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/c239f99478c2f7814795150f1b02b40f/5ADD1ED5/t51.2885-15/e15/12501789_593728234119448_888972563_n.jpg", "description": "Luckily I made this video for you yesterday, because I woke up this morning only to realize I totally threw out my back somehow overnight. \ud83d\ude29 Send me some healing back rub vibes and have a happy, restful, Saturday! \u2764\ufe0f "}, {"date": "2014-02-12T02:17:42.000Z", "comments": 25, "tags": [], "likes": 4835, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/43cd1130922fb60400e2fbb3ed5c20e3/5B67797C/t51.2885-15/e15/12950217_487529648105208_1694744400_n.jpg", "description": "Breathe in.

We all felt a little lost and ungrounded the other day, with no plans of where to stay or what to do after our plans fell through.\n\nScottsdale was only 5 hours away, and even if it's not home anymore, it sure still feels like it, and I think we all needed to feel home again for a day. So, to Scottsdale we went.\n\nThe funny thing is that I told myself \"Scottsdale is ONLY 5 hours away.\" LOL! Had you asked me 2 weeks ago if a place that takes 5 hours to drive to is far away, I would have told you it might as well be moon.\n\nAfter this time so far on the road, sometimes driving for up to 10 hour stretches, 5 hours seemed like a blink of an eye or the snap of a finger. ONLY 5 hours almost felt like a luxury.\n\nThis trip has reminded me that time really is relative, and can feel as slow or as fast as I decide to perceive it. \u270c\ud83c\udffb\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude90 "}, {"date": "2016-05-23T20:11:24.000Z", "comments": 24, "tags": ["#GloeLA", "#gloefromwithin", "#ad"], "likes": 3450, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/1f628549a73e5adea32100293d435d19/5B5BF55C/t51.2885-15/e35/13277840_978039775644035_348335689_n.jpg", "description": "Had such a blast teaming up with @aloegloe to teach a "}, {"date": "2014-07-31T16:28:19.000Z", "comments": 25, "tags": [], "likes": 4339, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/71d8784cba2afb58e119c728924844d9/5B6B8307/t51.2885-15/e15/12950436_1093758024028956_107450203_n.jpg", "description": "Flow through your day like water. \ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\udf0a"}, {"date": "2015-02-25T01:29:12.000Z", "comments": 25, "tags": ["#yogibox", "#beagoddess"], "likes": 4216, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/42b556a1a4013cd601772599d917c747/5ADCB540/t51.2885-15/e15/12912585_212914515748765_43729450_n.jpg", "description": "Today I woke up in a funk and was having trouble shaking it off.

Then one day, while I was alone in Alexa's apartment, feeling sorry for myself, I decided I couldn't be stagnant for another minute. Everything in me screamed that I needed to move my body. I needed to flow again.\nI got up off the couch, and just started playing around, not feeling up to an organized practice. Before I knew it, I realized I was actually having fun, and then I made this video.\nJust like that, from a very low place, my inspiration and drive returned. I felt like I could breathe again. At the end, you can see how happy I am, mostly because in that moment I stopped feeling so sad for a little while. Oh the magic of yoga.\nWatching this video, from my current happy life place, and remembering how I felt that day, reminds me that no matter how sh*tty things seem at the time, life will get better, and then I will enjoy looking back and seeing how far I've come. \ud83d\udc97\n-\n\ud83c\udfbc: Kiiara \"Gold\"\n"}, {"date": "2012-07-21T15:15:34.000Z", "comments": 2, "tags": ["#mischief", "#graceland", "#shady", "#elvis"], "likes": 79, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/e0caf5612ffa8ca79e051aa772f70850/5B6E5CFE/t51.2885-15/e15/12599186_711854822287884_1169298365_n.jpg", "description": "Being shady near AstroTurf covered walls at Graceland.

There is beauty in chaos, beauty in the death of leaves as the seasons change. There is beauty in mistakes, beauty in scars, beauty in memories of that time you learned something new through pain.\nThere was pain in falling and scraping my chin while learning to ride a bike. I still have the scar to prove it, but when I look at the scar, I don't remember the pain of falling. I remember the beauty of the experience. I remember the joy of spending time with my dad and the thrill of the wind whipping through my hair as I pedaled as fast as I could.\nBeauty is everywhere, if you choose to see it. Sure, the world is a crazy place where lots of things happen that are categorically NOT beautiful, but there's beauty in the balance of bad things happening to remind us to be present and cherish the good times even more when we have the chance.\n\nLook for beauty in the world, even when it seems like it's hiding. \u2764\ufe0f"}, {"date": "2015-03-06T18:34:11.000Z", "comments": 25, "tags": ["#beagoddess"], "likes": 2881, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/3acc985d0db620d46bd6fa5cf80c1d5f/5ADCE08B/t51.2885-15/e15/12965824_1144323165598825_83164330_n.jpg", "description": "T.G.I.FLOW!

But lately I'm becoming more aware of the ways that this same quality also succeeds at often taking the elements of fun and surprise out of life. \ud83d\ude14\nI figure I'm already an expert analyst, so recently I've been challenging myself to STOP analyzing everything... and it's not easy. \ud83d\ude2c\nI'm constantly tempted to fall back on my ability to analyze, but I've realized that if I analyze and try to predict everything, then I'm also tempted to try to overly control the outcome. \ud83e\udd14\nThat is maybe the root of all of this, and that's when life stops being surprising or fun, but instead becomes a futile struggle for control. This leaves a lot of space for disappointment, and chances to be reminded that I can never truly control anything except myself.... But here I am, over-analyzing myself again. As you can see it's easy for me to fall off the wagon. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude02\nHowever, all this thinking brings me back to my original practice: to STOP and remind myself that it's in the moments, when I stop over-thinking and over-analyzing, that I can be truly present to all of the magic, fun, and surprises that life has to offer. \ud83d\ude03\nWe each have a constant cycle that moves between being present and being in our minds, and that's life, but today I challenge you to stop thinking so much and let the magic in. \ud83d\udc97\n.\n\ud83d\udcf8: @sarahorbanicphotos // @aloyoga \ud83d\ude0d"}, {"date": "2018-01-20T18:56:09.000Z", "comments": 25, "tags": [], "likes": 6999, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/b0bc760fa27ac560a81fa4014b2d93d0/5B5F7061/t51.2885-15/e35/26180280_172227853541069_912229248121438208_n.jpg", "description": "Here in Tulum, I\u2019ve been forced daily to confront my demons, and acknowledge blind spots that have been tripping me up.\n.\nI\u2019ve been hesitant to share the past few days, because I feel that the captions I\u2019ve tried to write might scare you away.\n.\nSure, you love my light, but will you stay if my shadow enters the room with us? Or will it scare you away? Let\u2019s see. Here\u2019s the caption I was afraid to share today:\n.\nI often use anger to take my power back from someone who has stolen it from me (or maybe I\u2019ve even given it to them). It feels like it works in the short term, but it never really does.\n.\nAs sweet, vulnerable, and loving as I am, believe it or not, I can be incredibly scary when I choose to.

But the problem is, when I do this, I also give something priceless away: my peace.\n.\nWhat I\u2019m learning is, if I really want to take my power back, I\u2019ve got to take it back by loving even more and fearing even less. But damn, is that ever easier said than done.\n.\nIf I want to take my power back, and keep my peace intact, I have to be the bigger person: the one who forgives, the one who accepts responsibility for my role, and the one who sleeps soundly at night, because I\u2019m at peace with myself, my life, and the people in it.\n.\nSure, getting angry and spreading fear and sadness when I feel wronged, can sometimes (in a messed up way) feel like a win, but when I can\u2019t sleep later that night, it starts to feel more like a loss.\n.\nRemember that we\u2019re all just doing our best, and everyone makes mistakes. So forgive yourself, and then do your best to forgive whoever it is that you feel has wronged you.\n.\nTrue power comes from the ability to control yourself and your reactions. To know that you can choose to change your current state of being, and instead embrace a different feeling.\n.\nWhen you master that, no one can take it from you... at least that\u2019s what I keep telling myself. \ud83d\udc97\n.\n\ud83d\udcf8: @ryan_burke"}, {"date": "2015-01-07T21:10:27.000Z", "comments": 25, "tags": ["#grateful", "#charmedbycaneel"], "likes": 2860, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/5a99cbe2d88484ed23a14754890f4f50/5B6A3C46/t51.2885-15/e15/12070741_203372003378094_901633072_n.jpg", "description": "Perfect start to my next journey!

In this realm, all we have to go off of are our own narrow perceptions of others.\nWhen we make judgments about another person, based off of their Instagram posts; it is important to remember that these judgements are not based on truth or experience, they are based simply on YOUR perception.\nWe each have our own unique worldview that we use as the basis for all of our decisions. As a result, you may or may not understand/agree with my decisions, just as I may or may not understand/agree with yours. Neither of us are wrong, neither of us are right.\n\nMy decisions make sense to me, because I view them through my worldview. Your decisions may or may not make sense to me for the same reason: because I am viewing them through MY worldview and you are viewing them through YOURS.\n\nUntil we see through the eyes of others, until we live with their worldview, who are any of us to judge? Before you judge, and especially before you comment and share your judgement with the world, consider that you probably don't have all of the facts and also that you have no place to judge others in the first place.\n\nCase in point: my backless (not frontless) nude mesh and sequin bodysuit. I found it interesting that I felt compelled, in my first few posts, to share with you that I WASN'T topless.\nWhy? Because I was afraid that some of you would judge me, leave rude comments, or unfollow me. Lame.\n\nThis morning, I posted another photo of the bodysuit without the disclaimer that \"I'm NOT topless.\" Naturally, I immediately got comments asking why I'm topless, where my top is, etc.\nI AM in fact wearing a top here, but even if I wasn't that would be OKAY too.\nWant to know what I love most about Burning Man? The fact that there is NO judgement there, and ANYTHING GOES.\nI could be naked or I could be wearing the weirdest outfit you could possible conceive of, but I would still be free of judgement and deserving of love, respect and acceptance. \"Normal\" society could learn a thing or two from the inherent values of freedom, self-expression, respect, and acceptance in the Burning Man culture.

Have you ever felt this way?\nAs I've been trying to write this talk, I've become aware of how often I hit this wall of fear of not being good enough... and it's more often than I'd like to admit. For someone who has as many followers as I do, this probably sounds odd, but believe it or not, I'm a little afraid to be seen. You know, really seen, in all of my vulnerable and authentic glory.\nThat's actually why I said yes to giving this talk, even though in doing so, I made my stomach drop and my heart feel as if it was about to jump out of my body. That physical reaction, that visceral fear, reassures me that I've boarded an unstoppable train moving fast in the direction of personal growth.\nBut first, I have to write it, which I've been attempting to do all day. Tired of banging my head against the metaphorical wall, and sore from too much sitting, I decided to take this stretch and flow break before the sun set this evening, bringing me 1 day closer to Thursday.\nEnjoy this video, and wish me luck. \ud83d\udc97\n.\n\ud83c\udfbc: Banks \"Warm Water\""}, {"date": "2014-05-13T21:16:01.000Z", "comments": 25, "tags": [], "likes": 3735, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/9d81043767071d53dbb7379b01b6c14f/5B52421B/t51.2885-15/e15/12502011_1538838596412310_293297403_n.jpg", "description": "Sail away with me honey. \u26f5"}, {"date": "2014-04-17T13:52:38.000Z", "comments": 25, "tags": ["#yummy"], "likes": 4052, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/007d74812f77b585bd17c8bde4c40ced/5B55A1B4/t51.2885-15/e15/12976235_1540436919586074_1633208835_n.jpg", "description": "So refreshing!

Here is how I look at haters:\n\"Haters are a b*tch, but you practice believing and knowing they're full of sh*t, because YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE. Then one day the practice becomes the automatic reaction, and the haters empower you, because they only serve as a reminder of how awesome you know you are.\nIt's a challenging practice, but it makes you stronger and even more sure of who you are and how valuable your contribution to the world really is...and THAT is super empowering.\nWhen people diss you, your art, or something you passionately believe in, it sucks...there's no way around that. You can either believe them, or know they're wrong and channel it into a motivation to prove just how wrong they are.\nGot haters? Channel their hate into fuel for your own cleverness and creativity, and go do something epic with that fuel. Instead of letting haters disempower you, know deep down how amazing and irreplaceable you are, and be empowered by that knowledge.\" "}, {"date": "2017-06-18T21:55:23.000Z", "comments": 25, "tags": [], "likes": 2711, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/73d741bcf39d342702ed76055493b435/5B5884C3/t51.2885-15/e35/19227970_1468206816579234_783387985952374784_n.jpg", "description": "Feels incredible to be home...even if only for 36 hours.

With the absence of fear of falling, I began to progress far more quickly.\n\nThe key: become comfortable in forearm wheel and full wheel pose.\nIf you find yourself flipping over, just keep your arms solid in forearm stand and keep your elbows straight in handstand. Bend your knees and simply land on your feet in forearm wheel or full wheel.\nIf your arms stay strong, your feet will always hit the floor before your head.\n\nIt can be a little scary at first, but learning how to fall into wheel can change your entire outlook on inversion balances.\n\nUse the addition of this new knowledge to subtract fear of inversions from your practice. When you're ready, get upside down and let yourself fall.\nOh yes, and of course, please enjoy this video of me falling...

Here's a little secret about me that I don't talk about very often: I had a really hard time growing up.\nFor much of my childhood and teenage years, I was bullied and hurt. From 5th grade to high school, I switched schools 3 different times as a result.\n\nIt was hard. I cried a lot. I felt unlovable, uncool, and unworthy of friendship. I carried these feelings with me, in a heavy backpack, all the way into my 20s. Even into last year.\nEven as I found true friendships, and experienced the sensation of being loved, even as a lot of people on Instagram and in my life decided I'm \"cool\", I still told myself the same story: you are unlovable, you are uncool, and you are unworthy of friendship.\n\nI've grown and I've learned a lot since I started telling myself that sorry old story. For so long, I thought that the solution was to be someone other than myself, someone who was lovable, cool, and worthy of friendship. I was wrong, and all of you, my InstaBuddies, all of you played a role in helping me see that.\n\nInstagram is a trip. Admittedly, a part of it has been a continuation of the search for the acceptance that I've always yearned for. I've used it as a testing ground to find out what resonates with people and what doesn't, and which version of me resonates and which doesn't.\nWhat I found is that the only version of me that ever resonates with you guys, or anyone else, is the real me. What resonates more than the \"cool\" me, is the authentic me. The vulnerable me. It's in being honest, authentic, vulnerable, and fearlessly myself, that I feel lovable, cool, and worthy of friendship.\nAll of your likes, comments, and feedback (positive and negative) have helped me learn a lesson that I've been trying to learn for my entire life: Want to know the easiest way to be lovable, cool, and worthy of friendship? BE UNABASHEDLY, UNAPOLOGETICALLY, YOURSELF.\nI can tell you from research and experience, that YOU are what makes YOU lovable, cool, and worthy of friendship. Anything less is unacceptable. \u2764\ufe0f Photo cred: @justinbastien \ud83d\udcf7 "}, {"date": "2013-11-16T23:06:53.000Z", "comments": 25, "tags": [], "likes": 4086, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/4936488fa4f5cb8e26632e367782882f/5B6B2E48/t51.2885-15/e15/12383666_484572638333902_782809391_n.jpg", "description": "Feeling the vibes of the waves in my super cute @iamvibes top.

I can't believe that it's only been 1 year! This photo is from my Grand Canyon trip with @erincasey28 last May, one week after I joined Instagram.\n\nMy, how time flys when you're having fun, right? Thank you to @erincasey28 for knowing I would love Instagram, and suggesting it to me last year. Thank you also for taking this photo, one of my favorites EVER.\n\nSomething about this photo really resonated with me. Looking at it made me feel calm, inspired and happy. I wanted to share these \"insta-emotions\" with others.\nMaybe this photo would have the same impact on other people, as it had on me, and bring a little more joy into a few people's lives. I hoped so, but I was also afraid to share my life with people who might judge me.\n\nIt was this hope that gave me the confidence to get over my concern for perception of perfection and put myself out there. It's not always easy to be vulnerable to so many people, but for me it has been rewarding in so many other meaningful ways.\n\nOne of the most rewarding aspects are all of your awesome comments filled with love and encouragement. If I'm ever feeling down, I don't have to look any further than your encouraging comments for an amazing pick-me-up.\nI just wanted to take this moment to say THANK YOU.

I drew this heart with my finger and felt like a kid again.\nI live in Arizona now, but I grew up in Michigan, where it was often cold and there were lots of chances to draw hearts on foggy windows. I've had kind of a love-hate relationship with Michigan and the life that I led there in the past.\nGrowing up I was shy, scared, and I often felt like I wasn't good enough. I had very few friends, and those I did have seemed to stab me in the back regularly (as teenage girls unfortunately often choose to do). When I left Michigan to live in Paris for a month at 16 without my parents, everything changed. I was on my own for the first time, free to start writing a life story that I would actually enjoy reading.\nI returned from Paris a stronger and more confident young woman, but my life in Michigan still felt stifling and lonely and I couldn't wait to leave again. Instead of just resenting the people who had hurt me during my Michigan youth, I resented the state itself for a long time.\n\nAs I drew this heart and reminisced, instead of remembering pain, I remembered only the love I experienced there and the love that I have for the place that I came from.\nGrowing older can be scary, but one thing that I'm grateful for in this whole aging process is the many chances that I am given to forgive and let go of past hurts as more time passes.\n\nAsk yourself: Who or what can I forgive? What am I holding onto? What points of view are no longer serving me? What stories am I telling myself that are no longer true? The answers to these questions will eventually set you free, if you're willing to face them head on and let them go.\n\nHere is a bit of wisdom from my heart to yours: LET GO. When we let go of past resentment, when we forgive, we are free. In letting go, we make more space to fill with the love and joy of the present moment. \u270c\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude03"}, {"date": "2014-07-28T02:09:36.000Z", "comments": 25, "tags": ["#beagoddess"], "likes": 4523, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/139a2a6ca2d4a8d219663cd4226f4bef/5B56DAE2/t51.2885-15/e15/12935128_1768767863358951_1610420072_n.jpg", "description": "Mermaids on mermaids on mermaids. \u270c\ufe0f"}, {"date": "2014-07-09T02:38:19.000Z", "comments": 25, "tags": ["#ad"], "likes": 4040, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/c7f9ede0736b68312ac8302966db3752/5B56CA54/t51.2885-15/e15/12501863_1056019301126019_365721408_n.jpg", "description": "Sometimes life feels like a game.

Naturally. Beautifully. Blissfully.\n\nThe moment, captured in this photo, showed me that I AM \"good\" at meditation...if I just let it happen. As I sat, I let meditation wash over me and run through me, just like the water; an endless stream of consciousness flowing from one moment to the next.

It's crazy how, in the same moment, things can be both wonderful and awful, together and falling apart.\nI'm both ecstatically happy and incredibly sad about things that have come up lately in my life, and I'm not sure what to make of it all.\nSometimes I feel like my emotions are out of my control, and it's easy for me to go down the rabbit hole and get stuck in the negative emotions, no matter how amazing things actually are.\nIt makes me feel ungrateful to be in a place this beautiful, and be sitting here in my head, often worrying, rather than being present in the moment.\nBut then I remind myself that I am responsible for my own feelings, and that I have a choice. I can choose to tune into the positive or the negative.\nThey will both always be there, and it's important to experience both (no such thing as sunshine all the time unless you're fake or delusional), but I don't necessarily have to experience them in equal measures.\nSo in this moment, I actively choose light. I actively choose gratitude. That doesn't take away anything that's going on, it doesn't lessen my worries, but it makes everything feel a little better.\nWhen I'm stuck in my head, it's as if I can't see any of the beauty that's right in front me, but once I move, breathe, and calm myself from the inside out, I can see again, and I notice how beautiful our world is, and that makes me feel better too.\nJust remember that even if myself and others you follow on Instagram seem happy and lucky all the time, I assure you that things are not always entirely what they seem.\nRemember that the next time you envy my life or someone else's. With every bit of good, there's usually also a bit of bad, but we don't always show you that on Instagram.\nIf you take one thing from this post, please take this: life is a mixed bag, filled with positivity and negativity in equal measures. Don't hide from the negative. It's real and it's there, and it needs to be experienced...but don't let it eat you up, because our world is a beautiful place, and no matter what's going on in my life or yours, there are always so many things to be grateful for. \ud83d\udc97"}, {"date": "2013-04-11T23:54:41.000Z", "comments": 25, "tags": ["#yogafools"], "likes": 1747, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/6927edeff16608d9c6221430f36727ce/5B606485/t51.2885-15/e15/12912661_223174034714573_1198009847_n.jpg", "description": "This mermaid is floating!

That\u2019s easier said than done though, I know.\n.\nI used to run away and try to escape my life when I\u2019d feel this way, but the truth is, your problems will follow you to even the most idyllic locales.

That's a lot of pressure to put on myself and it's taken a toll lately. If the photo isn't color and light-corrected, hair perfect, pose perfect, most interesting backdrop ever, etc. I've been struggling to post it. Lame.\n.\nAs a result, I haven't been feeling very inspired to post lately. It's hard to live a perfectly \"on brand\" life and be so concerned with appearances all the time. It takes a ton of energy, and I feel like I've allowed this self-inflicted pressure to make me overly self-conscious, fearful, and exhausted.\n.\nYou can see the fear manifesting in my captions too, I'm sure. I used to write about my life pretty openly, good and bad, and I still sometimes do, but now my captions are often just that: captions to describe what you can already clearly see is happening in the photo. Not very inspiring.\n.\nThis is happening, because I've often been afraid to write about how I'm actually feeling (things have been hard for a few months now since my breakup and move to LA). I fear that if I show you other, maybe darker, sides of me, other than the bright shiny ones you already love and enjoy, then you'll think I'm a buzzkill and unfollow me. So I write, sometimes inauthentically, about flowers and unicorns instead, because I tell myself that's what you want from me.\n.\nLong story short: I'm sorry I tried so hard to be perfect, and in the process may have inadvertently sometimes become boring, inauthentic, and even unrelatable. I've honestly been a bit bored and uninspired by my posts lately, so I don't blame you if you've felt the same way sometimes.\n.\nI'm going to make a point to get back to my real self, not my \"perfect\" self. Sometimes I'm happy, and I feel inspired, and inspiring. Other times I'm sad, unmotivated, and I have a hard time...but inspiration can be found there too, in realness, strength, and vulnerability; and I need to remember that more often.\n.\nMantra: Life is still beautiful and can still be inspiring, even if there are no flowers or unicorns present. \u2600\ufe0f"}, {"date": "2017-02-05T01:44:17.000Z", "comments": 25, "tags": [], "likes": 7338, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/ad2ef13936a10a02306861d6b619df77/5B662D87/t51.2885-15/e35/16123925_1846813758900039_6594355596433031168_n.jpg", "description": "\ud83d\ude0d My favorite part of the newly opened @aloyogastore in Santa Monica... then again, I could be a bit biased. \ud83d\ude1c Grateful for my @aloyoga family! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc97"}, {"date": "2014-06-25T05:29:13.000Z", "comments": 25, "tags": ["#choosemythailand"], "likes": 5375, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/403e2c3ef20e29f2986828c732711098/5B69B02E/t51.2885-15/e15/1661012_1064443390279460_1156531298_n.jpg", "description": "Floating market meditation moment.

We aren't all catty, thank goodness, but unfortunately A LOT of us are.\nI got an above average number of nasty comments on my last video, a simple video of me practicing yoga on a beach. The sad thing is that the vast majority of the mean comments were from other women, mainly teenage girls. In my experience, this is almost always the case when it comes to rude comments.\n\nGirl on girl nastiness makes me so sad. It's so unnecessary. What does it achieve? Does it really improve your life to call me a slut or tell me I look anorexic? I'll go ahead and answer for you: no, it doesn't.\nWhy then are we as a gender so frequently judgmental and mean to our fellow women? Nasty comments from woman to woman don't just hurt the one on the receiving end, they hurt us all by perpetuating a negative cycle that often starts in our teenage years.\n\nInstead of trying to empower yourself by putting others down, I invite you to empower yourself by empowering others. Give compliments instead of slighting each other. Encourage instead of discouraging.\nI accept that negative comments are an unfortunate part of my reality, because I put myself out there and share my life with the world. But how lame is it that I have to accept this as reality?\nWhat would the world look like if we were quicker to be nice to each other than to be mean? Let me answer for you again: it looks AWESOME. That's a world that I want to live in.

Feeling torn about where home is, can be a really confusing experience, and at times it messed with my head a bit. Change and uncertainty are uncomfortable feelings for me, but I keep breathing through whatever comes up.\n\nInstead of getting too heady about it now (there's plenty of time for that on the road), I snuck in a little practice, focused breathing, and silhouette playtime, which always makes me happy.\n\nNow it's time to continue on this journey out of my comfort zone. Stay tuned... In the meantime, I hope you enjoy this video!

It was necessary, to an embarrassing degree. This is the result.\nRealizations from the morning: I love printed clothing. I'm awful at unpacking suitcases. I'm really great at washing and folding laundry, not so great at putting it away once it's folded. I apparently enjoy collecting empty bottles on my nightstand. Dirty laundry can hide in the weirdest places (how did it get there? I'd never put it there). The biggest realization though, is that I'm an expert at putting tasks off, when I'm not excited to complete them.\nPeople have always told me, \"clean room, clean life.\" \"organized room, organized mind.\" I didn't like to hear this, because, as a procrastination expert in the field of bedroom cleaning, I always told myself I didn't need an organized room to have an organized mind. I lied.\n\nHaving a clean bedroom makes a huge difference in the way I feel. I always forget this, but today it is an obvious difference between the way I felt when I woke up this morning (dirty room) and the awesome way I feel now (clean room). The aimless anxiety that I've been carrying for weeks, but couldn't place, GONE. The guilt of knowing I should be doing something, but instead I am choosing to procrastinate, GONE. Smile, sanity, RESTORED.\n\nMy new favorite moving meditation: Cleaning my room.

It feels natural for me to push myself as far as I can go. I'm comfortable with that.\n\nThis last week has been a challenge for me, because I've been forced out of my comfort zone and into taking it easy.\nI strained my back a week ago, by twisting a little too deeply. Don't worry, it's not bad and I'll be fine, but I've been taking it really easy on myself to make sure I don't hurt myself any further.\n\nIt's been a real eye-opener about my practice and how attached I have become to handstands and advanced poses.\nNow that I've been taking a break from the advanced poses I've been afraid to post. Afraid that if I'm not doing a handstand or tangling myself into a pretzel, that you guys won't like me or will unfollow me.\n\nSo, truly getting out of my comfort zone, this isn't a handstand or a pretzel, just a basic upward dog...and man, after hardly practicing for a week, the basic sun salutation, that this photo came from, felt as wonderful as any handstand I've ever done.\n\nWhat have I learned? Several important lessons: -always practice safety first and respect my body and my limitations -don't be SO attached to advanced poses, because the basics feel just as good -don't be so attached to the opinions and \"likes\" of others -taking it easy isn't the same as taking a step back, if anything it's a step forward in my personal growth\n\nToday is the first day that I'm feeling pretty close to back to normal. So, I'm sure you'll be seeing handstands and pretzels from me again in no time.\n\nEven if it's been challenging this last week, I'm still grateful for the experience and the important lessons that I've learned.\n\nNever be afraid to love yourself and take it easy sometimes.

Did falling make me imperfect? Or had I been imperfect all along before I even walked outside?\n\nI meditated on these questions, and here's what I came up with:\n\nI am not perfect. I am not imperfect. I am perfectly imperfect. I was perfectly imperfect when I woke up this morning. I was perfectly imperfect while I was holding the handstand and while I was falling. I am perfectly imperfect as I write this.\n\nLife is perfectly imperfect and that's what makes it so amazing.

Perfectly imperfect.\n\nDo you love your perfectly imperfect self? I do. I love you because you are perfectly imperfect. I love you because I am perfectly imperfect.

So many of them had done me wrong in the past. Growing up, I was backstabbed, shit talked, and everything in between. I had to change schools 4 times, because mean girls chose me as their target, and the whole thing was pretty traumatic. \ud83d\ude25\n.\nAs a result, I used to avoid women like the plague. The majority of my best friends were men, because men felt safer, more predictable, and thankfully, less catty. \ud83d\ude43\n.\nBut then I grew up, and I started feeling the void of female friends in my life. Slowly but surely, I decided to trust. Slowly but surely, I let my guard down. Slowly but surely, I started collecting girlfriends, until I had as many female friends as male friends. \ud83d\udc6f\n.\nSure, there are still mean girls out there, even now that we\u2019re all adults, but I\u2019m not afraid of them anymore. I find that fear can be a self-fulfilling prophecy. The more I feared them, the more I attracted them. But then I got to know myself better and love myself more deeply. \ud83d\udc97\n.\nThe more I practiced this self-love and self-acceptance, the less insults, slights, or purposeful exclusion in group situations, were able to impact me. With my new thicker skin, I was less afraid to put myself out there, less afraid of rejection, and less afraid of making new friends. \ud83d\ude03\n.\nNow, rather than being afraid of women, I cherish all of my girlfriends and I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without them. I\u2019m even genuinely excited to make more. \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb\n.\nIn a world that sometimes praises mean girls, don\u2019t be one of them, and don\u2019t be afraid of them, because that just gives them more power. \ud83d\ude45\ud83c\udffc\n.\nInstead, lead by example: support and befriend the women around you. Let\u2019s lift each other up and rise together. Who\u2019s with me?! \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc6f\n.\n\ud83d\udcf8: new friend @sfreneenyc\nPlaying sirens and mermaids with new friends @aminahtaha and @gabriella.dondero.

Here are some thoughts on gratitude as I wake up this morning:\n\nToday I'm feeling so grateful. I thought about making a list to share with you, but the truth is that the list is never-ending.\nI'm grateful for everything. The good and the bad. The easy and the challenging. The friends and the foes. Gratitude is more than a feeling. It's a practice.\n\nThanksgiving reminds us to be grateful for a day, but I say, think of everyday like thanksgiving. Practice being grateful for the things that make you happy, but also for the things that make you sad (and stronger). Practice being grateful on the days when it seems like you have nothing to be grateful for. Those are the days, especially, when gratitude leaves the realm of feeling and transcends to the realm of practice.\nOn the darkest days, the practice of gratitude is a challenge, so be grateful for days like today when gratitude comes easily. Let the feeling fill your heart with love and appreciation. Then remember how that feels.\nPut it in a memory jar and save it for the dark days. Gratitude is always there for you. Ready to make you smile, feel loved, and to remind you that life is good, even when it's challenging.\n\nTime to go gorge on Thanksgiving feast now. Nom nom nom.\n\nHappy Thanksgiving!

Wednesday. It's cold and rainy here in Phoenix, which I love on days when I can just stay in bed and watch movies and eat soup all day. Today I don't have time for that though, gotta be productive!\n\nNot my most inspiring post ever, so far, but I share this with you because I'm sure you've woken up tired and slightly uninspired too. It happens to all of us.\n\nWhat do you do on the tired days? How do you motivate? How do you get through it?\n\nI usually get up, take a shower to shake the cobwebs off, and then plan out my day. I take a few small moments to myself to simply gather my thoughts and work on my to-do list for the day. Sometimes seeing what I need to do, on paper, helps me see that it's doable, even if the list is long.\n\nThen, ideally if I have time, I eat a nice breakfast where I don't multitask. No phone. I just enjoy my last few free minutes before I get to work.\nUsually by this point, I'm feeling awake, feeling better, and not feeling so overwhelmed.

I decided to go surprise an unsuspecting @danielle_cree at work.\n\nDanielle didn't know I was coming, because we had never met. Yesterday, she left a nice comment on my @instagram, inviting me to come check out @snoozeameatery, where she works.\n\nI don't usually go around surprising unsuspecting @gypsetgoddess fans at work, but today I had a wild hair and decided to get out of my comfort zone and do something different.\n\nWhen I asked if the seat next to her was open, she turned to me, her eyes got wide, she flipped out a little, gave me a huge hug, and then kinda stared at me in disbelief. It was awesome and awkward all the same time, and it made me happy.\n\nI can sometimes be socially awkward, so going out of my way to meet new people can be a challenge. As usual, my social awkwardness was present, but it was far outweighed by another sensation: how great it felt to go out of my way to make a stranger so happy, just because I could.\n\nI've been on a spree with this lately. Random acts of kindness toward strangers that end up being incredibly fulfilling. I'm enjoying myself and making people happy along the way, so I think I'll keep this up.\n\nIf you see that I'm in your city, let me know about an event you're going to, or where you'll be working or chilling and when, and I might just come surprise you!\n\nThis day turned out to be so much fun. I went from having no plans, to making a new friends' day and taking an amazing tour of Boulder with her...and all of that change happened in the space of a simple decision to do something kind, just for the fun of it, just because I could.\n\nThe moral of the story? Share kindness with strangers, whenever you get the chance or the urge, because beautiful things, like new friendships and memories, can come out of this sense of oneness and connection.\n\nBONUS: it just feels awesome to give the gift of happiness to another human. So, go forth and make a stranger smile. \ud83d\ude03 "}, {"date": "2013-07-22T16:33:08.000Z", "comments": 25, "tags": [], "likes": 1885, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/06dd12e52d8d132c13fe91aaa8addcc9/5B704435/t51.2885-15/e15/12070777_1770345023195829_586058484_n.jpg", "description": "I've noticed an interesting double standard that exists in our society.\nWhy is it socially acceptable to comment on weight when a person is skinny, but not socially acceptable to comment when someone is overweight?

When you feel offended, what do you do about it?\n.\nI ask these questions, because as a society, I feel like we're becoming a little too touchy.\n.\nThat's not to say there isn't a ton of offensive stuff going on everyday, because it's all undeniably there, but at the same time it seems that some have started to welcome that feeling of offense, and the temptation towards self-righteousness that often accompanies it.\n.\nI feel like as soon as we combine self-righteousness with a feeling of offense, it becomes dangerous. In this case we run the risk of allowing ourselves to become offended more often, because when we become offended we also get to feel \"right\".\n.\nFeeling \"right\" does feel good. I get it. However this craving to be \"right\" is making a lot of us too quick to point out how others are wrong whenever we get the chance.\n.\nIf we continue this way, does being offended not become like crying wolf?\n.\nInstead of being offended by every little thing that we take personally, can we please take a step back, and save our offense and righteous indignation for situations where it really matters? Each of us must self-regulate, and honestly be our own judge of when this is the case, and when it isn't.\n.\nBeing so easily offended by everything around us doesn't bring us together. It polarizes us, it separates us, it makes us right vs. wrong, it makes us angry, it makes us fight, and it makes us, as a population, easier to control. (Ever heard the phrase \"divide and conquer\"??)\n.\nI'm all about social justice and righteous indignation (keyword: righteous, not superfluous), but otherwise, can we please chill out?\n.\nIf you're truly offended about something, then do something about it. Take action, don't just complain. If you're just taking things too personally, instead take a deep breath and try to take things with a grain of salt today. \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\udc97\n-\n\ud83d\udcf8: @iliscrub"}, {"date": "2014-01-01T02:33:22.000Z", "comments": 25, "tags": [], "likes": 8442, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/bf38000e64a226ed50384291b37a2b19/5B67D305/t51.2885-15/e15/12446335_862563557177714_1488789846_n.jpg", "description": "Underwater handstand...well, sort of.

I performed a social media fast over the weekend, because I've been having a pretty hard time personally lately, and I felt like I had completely run out of inspiring things to say.\n\nI guess I was thinking of it along the lines of my own version of the famous old adage: if you don't have something positive or inspiring to say, don't say anything at all. So, I didn't for 4 days.\n\nI woke up today wanting to post, but I still felt like I had nothing positive or inspiring to add to the world. That's when it hit me: not everything in life is directly positive and inspiring. And that's okay.\n\nWhile the world is filled with positive experiences, it is also filled with neutral experiences and sometimes downright sucky experiences too. And that's okay.\n\nSure, it may not be inspiring in the traditional way to admit to you that right now I'm having a really tough time, and that life isn't looking as rainbowy and unicornish as usual; to tell you I don't have an inspiring quote or story to share with you today and may not tomorrow either; but it doesn't help me or anyone else to hide and be silent until I do.\n\nSometimes I get so focused on writing about smiling and being happy, that it makes me afraid to share anything else. In this situation, I'm forced to remind myself that vulnerability can be as inspiring, or often more so, than rainbows and unicorns. The reality is that sometimes life is messy, and we have nothing positive to say, but we endure. We keep on truckin' and we keep on keepin' on.\n\nSo, in the interest of practicing what I preach, here I am: sad, vulnerable, and potentially uninspiring, but I'm okay with that for now. If life isn't rainbows and unicorns for you right now, oh well. Keep sharing, keep living, keep loving, keep trying, and just keep going. Know that you are not alone in your experience. \u2764 To those of you who are having an awesome day, don't let this post get you down.

Today I'm moving out of the house where I've basically lived for the last 2 years with my ex-boyfriend. The final step in closing this last chapter, and the first step in beginning to figure out how the next chapter will look.\n\nChange is scary, but it's also exhilarating and liberating (that's what I need to keep reminding myself). It's hard, and the memories are flowing like tears on a sad face, but I'm grateful. I'm grateful, because as I passively observe the memories of this relationship, and the last 3 years of my life, the happy ones outweighs the sad tenfold.\n\nSo many of my relationships have served to teach me what I don't want, but this most recent one has served to teach me what I do want, and I'm grateful for that too.\n\nIn moments like this, it's easy to let the fear creep in and take hold. It makes me question whether I'm making the right decision, or whether I will have regret. The fear tells me to stay here and stay in my comfort zone, because if I leave I might fail.\n\nFear has a function. It keeps us alive and makes us think twice before doing something dangerous, but so much of life is dangerous, so we push through the fear and keep living.\n\nIt's true, I might fail, but I also might succeed beyond my wildest dreams. I won't know unless I try, and as Yoda says, \"there is not try, there is only do.\" So I'm doing it. I am moving out. I am changing. I am doing my best. I am learning. I am growing. I am living a completely adventurous, passionate, weird life.\n\nSometimes it's scary, but even so, I wouldn't have it any other way...and that's what I keep telling myself when the going gets rough. \ud83d\ude09"}, {"date": "2014-07-06T02:03:57.000Z", "comments": 25, "tags": ["#ad"], "likes": 5052, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/35f706571d0a06a7c93e073f2de47ab3/5B5D3A2B/t51.2885-15/e15/12912348_1589924914632137_794026895_n.jpg", "description": "Goodbye paradise!

Then this morning I was in a juicy yoga class from @donnyoga, and a lightbulb went on for me: This saying is also true from an emotional perspective.\n.\nOver the years I\u2019ve become an expert at running away from negative feelings. I\u2019d smoke weed, drink alcohol, and do anything else I could to distract myself from feelings that I didn\u2019t want to feel.\n.\nIf you\u2019ve followed me for awhile, then you know that the past few months were pretty rocky for me. Too many aspects of my life unexpectedly went sideways, until I was left in a state of undeniable and almost constant depression and anxiety.\n.\nUnlike in the past, this time there were too many things, that actually really mattered, going sideways, and I couldn\u2019t afford to just run away and tune out.\n.\nThis forced me to sit in it, to feel my feelings to their fullest degree. There were days where I felt as if I had forgotten how to be happy, forgotten what that even felt like. I wondered if the clouds would ever lift, and it scared me.\n.\nRegardless of my fear and discomfort, I sat in it anyway, and it. was. HARD.\n.\nGratefully, over the last month and a half, the clouds have been parting, and the sun has started shining again. Forgotten feelings of joy have been bubbling up to the surface more and more frequently.\n.\nThen today in class, it hit me.\n\u201cIf you can feel it, you can heal it.\u201d\n.\nI left class with a spring in my step, and noticed it immediately. I knew that this was the best I\u2019ve felt in months, but the important realization is in how I created this new happiness: I allowed myself to truly feel all of my feelings. Once I felt them, I knew how to heal them, and the work could begin.\n.\nIf you\u2019re feeling down, I\u2019m here to encourage you to sit in it, breath into it, and experience whatever comes up, even if it feels scary.\n.\nThe quickest way, and really the only way out, is always through. So be brave. Go through it, and remember that the sun WILL shine again, and you WILL get through this. \ud83d\udc97\n.\n\ud83d\udcf8: @lifeinabeachtown"}, {"date": "2014-03-02T16:08:52.000Z", "comments": 25, "tags": ["#yogablisstv", "#grateful"], "likes": 4444, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/b1ab2dce046302d2157aa610bfde3213/5B6FC8B7/t51.2885-15/e15/12934867_1574702726175254_1607995336_n.jpg", "description": "Chillin between takes for Yoga Bliss (airing soon on The Indonesia Channel).

A new form of \u201cSnapchat Dysmorphia\u201d.\n.\nHave you ever felt like you\u2019re not enough without a little filtering? Some cat ears, a flowery headband, or the real point: smoother skin, bigger eyes, and fuller lips?\n.\nI\u2019ll be honest with you: I have. I still sometimes do, and I\u2019m tired of it.\n.\nI\u2019m experiencing my own cognitive dissonance, where I want to be fully authentic with you here, but also feel a pressure to conform to the beauty expectations of social media, where we are so used to the absence of wrinkles, rolls, cellulite, and any other characteristic that society has deemed unseemly.\n.\nI intimately understand the drive to post photos I look good in (more likes!), and I\u2019m not opposed to a little FaceTune when the wrong angle makes me look different than I actually am or I have a zit that\u2019s really bothering me, but I\u2019m so tired of the blatant fakeness of so many of the faces and bodies that we see as we scroll.\n.\nIn the past, I wouldn\u2019t have posted this without editing out the natural roll at my waist (unavoidable in this pose), but like I said, I\u2019m tired... and the truth is, I\u2019m starving for more REALITY on this platform.\n.\nThis is only my opinion, and it\u2019s not even fully formed, but I\u2019m curious how you feel about all of this?
