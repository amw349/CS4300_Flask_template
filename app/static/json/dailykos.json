At the same time, she and her children moved to California to forge a new, hopefully safer life. She worked in advertising and community affairs during the 70s, and also gave speeches for the NAACP. She wrote a book chronicling Medgar's life, and even ran (unsuccessfully) for Congress in 1970.\n\u2014\nAfter decades of serving her new hometown of Los Angeles, she was appointed to the city's board of Public Works in 1987. As a member of the NAACP board during a time of turmoil, she opted to run for chair in 1995, and won. During her three-year tenure she turned the organization's reputation and financials around, and stepped down in 1998. She later went on to establish the Medgar Evers Institute, in Mississippi.\n\u2014\nIn recent years, Evers-Williams, twice a widow, continues to speak out about racial inequality, and write books about her own journey and that of her first husband. She's received at least 7 honorary doctorates over the years, been honored as Ms. Magazine's Woman of the Year, and received the National Freedom Award in 2009.\n\u2014\nAfter Barack Obama was re-elected in 2012, Evers-Williams became the first woman of any race, and the first non-clergy, to deliver an invocation at a presidential inauguration.\n\u270a\ud83c\udfff\u270a\ud83c\udffe\u270a\ud83c\udffd\u270a\ud83c\udffc "}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/290e8c14a92cbabf5ef4f0a9fce12b9b/5B7C4D7A/t51.2885-15/s1080x1080/e15/fr/26866455_1835988220031765_1666242264814321664_n.jpg", "tags": ["#DailyKos", "#GOTV", "#Vote", "#Vote2018", "#Midterms", "#Midterms2018", "#FlipTheSenate", "#FlipTheHouse", "#Democrats", "#Dems", "#Progressive", "#Liberal", "#NotMyPresident", "#Congress", "#House", "#Senate", "#Elections", "#LocalElection", "#EveryVoteCounts", "#RegisterToVote", "#Politics", "#Politicians", "#45", "#DonaldTrump", "#GOP", "#Republicans", "#ChecksAndBalances", "#USA"], "comments": 0, "likes": 66, "date": "2018-01-26T03:52:11.000Z", "description": "The GOP currently controls the House, the Senate, the White House, and placed the majority of current Supreme Court justices.

As he ascended through the ranks of the Anglican Church, both at home and in England, Tutu used his religious clout to fight apartheid, becoming the first black man to hold increasingly significant leadership positions within the church. As his prominence reached an international scale, the South African government hesitated to make a martyr out of him, so he was able to avoid severe state-sanctioned retribution in ways that non-clergy activists like Nelson Mandela were not.\n\u2014\n\nAs the so-called \"moral conscience of South Africa,\" Tutu has long supported reconciliation and forgiveness rather than retribution and resentment, and received criticism for being too quick to believe that unity was possible among the races. Though officially retired, Tutu has continued to fight for human rights, speaking out against everything from the war in Iraq to the occupation in Palestine; and calling for a united global response to the AIDS epidemic and climate change. He equates homophobia and limitations on LGBTQ rights with racism and apartheid, and is dismissive of those in the church who say otherwise.\n\u2014\n\nTutu's wife LEAH is also an educator and activist.

Daily Kos is excited to endorse her in this race.\n**\nEscobar, a third-generation El Pasoan, directed a local nonprofit before beginning her career as a public servant, serving first as a county commissioner and later as El Paso County judge. From that perch, Escobar fought to increase transparency and accountability in county government, and she was instrumental in expanding local access to affordable health care.\n**\nEscobar is also a recognized expert on\u2014and tenacious fighter for\u2014immigrants\u2019 rights and issues related to the U.S.-Mexico border, including trade. Last year, Escobar led judges and mayors across Texas as they denounced the state attorney general\u2019s efforts to rescind DACA, and she took on the state\u2019s new 'anti-sanctuary cities' law that would have forced local police to enforce federal immigration law. **\nA staunch progressive, Escobar is an advocate for a broad array of Democratic priorities. In Congress, Escobar will push progressive priorities like access to childcare, paid leave, and equal pay for women.\n**\nEscobar is also in a position to make some long-overdue history: She would be the first Latina ever to represent Texas in Congress.\"\n**\nYou can support @vgescobar915 at dailykos dot com!\n**\n"}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/f5fb1a3c8e964be32b887bf882d399de/5B5DD46A/t51.2885-15/s1080x1080/e15/fr/27893247_171539370236909_2030652501664989184_n.jpg", "tags": [], "comments": 4, "likes": 68, "date": "2018-02-22T21:07:26.000Z", "description": "DR.

By 1850, she was giving speeches to audiences increasingly open to the fight against slavery, including her iconic \"Ain't I a Woman\" speech in Akron, Ohio. Her focus went beyond abolition after the Emancipation Proclamation, as she focused on prison reform, desegregation, and eliminating capital punishment. She continued to give speeches until her age kept her home.

Later, during WWII, the US military trained the pacifist in mechanical engineering.\n\u2022\nAfter fighting in the Battle of the Bulge, Vonnegut, along with 50 other Allied soldiers, was taken captive and moved to Dresden. As a POW, he survived a brutal Allied attack on the city by hiding in an underground meat locker.\n\u2022\nAfter the war, Vonnegut married his childhood sweetheart and they both enrolled at the University of Chicago; neither would graduate, but they did go on to have three children of their own, in addition to adopting Vonnegut's three nephews after his sister's death. Vonnegut and his wife would later part amicably; he had another child with his second wife.\n\u2022\nVonnegut's writing career grew slowly. While working as a reporter, and then a publicist, he began selling short stories on the side. When he decided to write full-time in 1951, he had no idea it would be 18 years before his first commercial success, SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE, would be published.\n\u2022\nThough he never managed to achieve the same runaway success of SLAUGHTERHOUSE, Vonnegut continued to write, teach, and speak his mind until his death. All in all, Vonnegut published fourteen novels, three short story collections, five plays and five non-fiction books.\n\n"}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/c1e5fdea16e8ba5a0e1830f6a9099128/5B7CEE4A/t51.2885-15/e35/30084389_184229265548584_4352698193398464512_n.jpg", "tags": ["#deplorable", "#oklahoma", "#oklahomateachers", "#teachers", "#strike", "#union", "#fairwages", "#teachersdeservemore", "#maryfallin", "#governor", "#shestheworst", "#dailykos", "#deplorables"], "comments": 9, "likes": 63, "date": "2018-04-06T23:27:27.000Z", "description": "Luckily for Oklahoma residents, Fallin isn\u2019t eligible for re-election.\n\n"}, {"img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/fb4f42bfcc69b26fe62d28f488972678/5B7C7D47/t51.2885-15/s1080x1080/e15/fr/29416285_155752525065669_2463319930741719040_n.jpg", "tags": ["#ACA", "#ACAHereToStay", "#ThanksObama", "#Obamacare", "#ACA", "#HealthcareIsAHumanRight", "#HealthcareForAll", "#HealthcareIsARight", "#HealthyHappy", "#AffordableHealthcare", "#AffordableCareAct", "#HBDACA", "#HBD", "#HappyBirthday"], "comments": 3, "likes": 170, "date": "2018-03-23T21:13:40.000Z", "description": "We love this post from our very own @benjaminokeefe.\nThe Affordable Care Act turns 8 today!
