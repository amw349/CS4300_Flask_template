My cranky left shoulder didn't bother me and my chest really opened up.\nI used 12lb DBs for 8 reps of each exercise. You don't need to go heavy. This complex focuses on activating upper back.. Scapular retractors, rear deltoids, triceps (primarily the superior insertion responsible for shoulder extension. Think L seat hold) It also opens up your anterior chain primarily pec and pec minor.\nThese are all controlled movements. If you can't hold each position for a full second the weight is too heavy!\n1) Rocket man raise - keep your abs tight and focus on lifting through your shoulders, NOT pulling you chest off the bench. This focus is shoulder extension not thoracic extension ( which is often used as a compensatory motion if shoulder mobility or stability are inadequate ). Palms face up. Keep your arms straight. You will feel your lats and triceps fire!\n2) Retraction to kick back - same body position as above. Retract scapular, squeezing shoulder blades together as you extend your arms. Triceps and upper back should be screaming at you.\n3) W fly - arms bent at 90 degrees. Using a reverse fly motion lift and pause at the top. This move is less about retraction and more focused on horizontal abduction firing the posterior delts and rhomboids.\n4) Stretch fly - control the DBs down to a stretched position at the bottom of the fly. Hang out here for a few seconds. Keep you hands even with your shoulders, i.e. Making a T.. You can experiment with lowering them slightly above your shoulders making a wide Y to increase stretch to the pec minor which is notoriously tight.\nDo 1 set or 8 as part of your upper body warm up.\nDo 2-3 sets or 8-10 as a finisher pump on your upper body day.\nHave an awesome day!!!!

So including some isolation work is going to be necessary too.\nI also get bored as heck doing 4x10s of straight sets, especially for single joint moves, so I mix up variations in a complex or Tri Set to keep the volume up.\nCheck out all 3 videos-\nProgram Rx\nVideo 1\nTall kneeling curl Complex (this on is from Anarchy Abs)\nPronated curl x5\nSupinated curl x 5\nHammer curl x 5\nHammer curl to press x 5 (2x through is 1 round, the video is the last half of my second round) ----------------------- Video 2\nTriceps complex (This one I learned from @jlifting and still love for a high volume set)\nSkull crusher x 5\nRolling press x 5\nClose grip press x 5\n(3x through is 1 round)\nDo 1 round of biceps followed by 1 round of triceps.

Also, they work the long head of the tricep which inserts into your scapula, crossing the shoulder joint and is (partly) responsible for shoulder extension, an often overlooked function of the triceps. Think L sit or reverse plank!\nStart with light weights and get through all the reps.

Try these 3 variations from top trainer @andyspeer: plyo, eccentric, and jumping. Plyo pullups build power and increase the gravitational effect on the way down. Eccentric pullups (taking 4 seconds or longer to lower) increase muscle work and help you build up to full range of motion reps. Jumping pullups allow you to cheat to the top position to get more reps while also boosting the cardio and metabolic response.

They allow you to combine a strength, hypertrophy and endurance in one set. I LOVE using compound sets for back work because of the added benefit of grip strength.\nAdd this compound tri-set into you next upper body or back focus workout. The rotational element and bar placement on the inverted rows also gives your biceps a extra hit.\nProgram Rx\nRing Pull x 6\nRotational Single arm row x 8\nReverse grip Inverted row x 12-15\nDo 3 rounds\nRest 10-20s between exercises\nRest 90s - 2min between sets\n\nCoaching cues * Do chin ups if you are using a bar * If you can do 10 BW chins, add weight to make 6 reps challenging * Control the motion in the rotational row. Go as heavy as you can still allowing a squeeze for a full second at the top *You can use DB or KB for the row * Set your position on the inverted rows so the bar hits just above your nipple line. You will feel your grip and biceps working. This position forces more elbow flexion in the supinate grip similar to a curl. ( this is a variation, traditionally I would say pull the bar just under your nipple line for greater lat activation)\nHave fun with this and have an awesome day!!!

A recent change in technique still working on it.\nSingle arm DB bench - I do 3:1 right to left as I'm rehabbing a cranky left shoulder that needs more stability and mobility work. My left pec is overactive due to non optimal shoulder function. My right pec lags in size because right shoulder is so strong. So stability with locked left arm, and pec work with more reps on the right. ( I go in phases with the asymmetrical volume)\nShoulder mobility - FRC - just started using this drill. Need to better prevent compensatory thoracic extension and torso rotation during the movement. Opening tight pecs and biceps while focusing on keeping arm locked with the triceps and scapular retracted.\nPush ups - Gymnastics bodies Foundations course. All ways room for the basics.\nStraddle press outs - another Gymnastics bodies foundations exercise. Need to lock left leg.

These 5 moves will mobilize and stretch you upper back. If tightness or pain is chronic always get it checked out by a professional.\nHere we go... 1) Thoracic extension on the foam roller. Place your shoulder blades in the top of the roller. Support your head with your hands and keep your elbows pointing up, not out. Keep some tension in your abs, don't let your ribs pop up and your low back arch. Do 5 extensions in that spot them move 2 inches about and 2 inches below and do the same.\n2) Kneeling thoracic rotation. Set up like a child's pose with your torso at 30-45 degrees. Thread right arm through your left arm and knee trying to get you right shoulder to the floor. Hold the stretch for 5 seconds then rotate your right arm up to the ceiling. Do 6-8 on each side.\n3) Cat cow. Round your back by pushing through your shoulders and tucking your hips then arch your back and look up gently while still push through your shoulders. Do 10.\n4) Scapular push ups. Same set up as the cat cow. Push your torso to the floor by squeezing your shoulder blades together then push you torso away from the floor be separating your shoulder blades. Keep you back straight. Do 10.\n5) Side lying thoracic rotation. Set up on your side with bottom leg straight and top leg bent 90 degrees with knee at hip level. Open your top arm over the top making an arch. The goal it to eventually get the back of your shoulder to the floor, not crank your arm down. Breath out gently as you reach the stretch position. Do 8 each side.\nHopefully this will loosen you up. Do these in the morning or before you workout.\nHave an awesome Sunday!"}, {"date": "2016-10-26T22:38:50.000Z", "comments": 1, "tags": ["#Repost", "#FitTruck", "#bemorehuman", "#dreamchaser", "#livealifeuncommon"], "likes": 180, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/cb6bf034991740e945e718526502894d/5B6609A0/t51.2885-15/e35/14718270_1318326948200758_6912810838562701312_n.jpg", "description": "Well said, @andrewconnor_ .\n"}, {"date": "2016-03-11T17:15:33.000Z", "comments": 14, "tags": ["#fridayfunday", "#FlexFriday", "#AndySpeer", "#Gymnastics", "#Abs", "#Core", "#BodyweightExercises", "#BodyweightTraining", "#Fitness", "#"], "likes": 6697, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/6a9b213db298741cd2dfa0454b6cda9f/5ADCB154/t51.2885-15/e15/12822423_833388133474589_2127464158_n.jpg", "description": "Have an awesome "}, {"date": "2015-02-19T12:26:06.000Z", "comments": 10, "tags": ["#grateful", "#l4l", "#f4f", "#fitfam"], "likes": 214, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/2189843d2cc132e9661018c96474681e/5B510CB5/t51.2885-15/e15/10986105_1573533726238554_1649428166_n.jpg", "description": "Throwin' it back to the 'Day in the Life' shoot with ReebokOne.

I used 15lb and that was plenty. \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffbBird dog renegade row - This is very challenging. It's ok if your weight shifts slightly over your down arm. Keep your hips squared up to the floor and your knee under your hip, not out to the side. Take it slow. Adjust foot and hand position for balance. \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffbHollow body angel - like a snow angel for abs. This works your pecs, shoulders and lats too. Think about pulling your arms in towards your spine while pushing your hands up (against gravity) with your chest and lats. You don't want full retraction of the scaps, just enough tension to keep them from sliding out to the side or up towards your ears. Control the motion, don't rush this one. \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffbT plank to side press - drive the lower arm hard into the DB, pushing your torso away from the floor. On the side press think about pulling your elbow behind your torso with you lat. Open your chest, without letting your ribs pop out. Try to create a stretch in the your pec/ pec minor ( depending on how tight you are) and tension on the medial edge (closest to the spine) of your scapula). \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffbHollow scissor w DB - Keep your biceps by your ears in the open position. Control the motion both directions. \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffbOverhead Rocks - classic rock with an extra hit for the lats and abs.\nGear: @reebok\nHave fun with this one and have an awesome Saturday!!!

Your mindset as you approach each and every challenge dictates not only the external outcome, but more importantly your internal reaction to that outcome, and even more importantly- your adaptation and growth during the process which then leads to your ability to handle more demanding challenges in the future. Right from the start look for the positive in the situation, it may not be staring you in the face, give it a minute, take a breath, look through the eyes of POSITIVE PERSPECTIVE and ask yourself:\n\n1) What will I learn/gain/improve upon having overcome this challenge? (GROW)\n2) How will that increase my ability to be of service to others? (GIVE)\n\nBe honest and specific in you answers. Realize from the get go this process will not be easy but will be worth it.

Program Rx -\nAs a warm up do 2 sets in each side with a light/ medium bell.\nAs a part of your total body workout do 3-4 sets with a medium/ heavy bell. The halos will be your limiting factor for loading in this complex.\nHave an awesome Friday!!!

I'll take 5-10 slow deep breathes, adjust my feet slightly to increase the range of the stretch and repeat. (I shortened the breathing and stretch time for the video). For the pec and forearm/wrist stretch. I pull myself into position with control, breath I the stretch position, then actively push myself out of the stretch with the muscles I'm stretching, then pull myself back into the stretched position.\nStart with 5 sets of 5 breaths per stretch, work you way up to 10 sets of 10 breaths per stretch. That means in a row with the the only 'break' being when you adjust the stretch at the end of the breathing sets.\nThis is work, not lazy stretching.\nYour body will thank you!\nHave fun with this and have an awesome day!"}, {"date": "2016-12-24T22:31:36.000Z", "comments": 14, "tags": ["#couch", "#potato", "#workout", "#doitforyou", "#hollyjollychristmas"], "likes": 8250, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/fca4aeb93a240da5bd244c7bbe07824d/5ADCA683/t51.2885-15/s1080x1080/e15/fr/15535448_337598713305140_1484470130632032256_n.jpg", "description": "Christmas couch potato workout!\nI was a couch potato today... spent a few hours on the couch watching football and managed a well needed nap.

Outside of gymnastics, I didn't have much confidence in myself. My entire life I have had a very difficult time expressing my emotions, both positive and negative. I held in all my angst, uncertainty and lack of confidence. I figured it would get better or go away at some point. I put most of my value as a person on how I looked from a very young age and thought if I 'looked normal' I would change and become a 'better person' and people would like me more.\nI grew my hair out to cover my ears and put on 45 lbs of muscle my first two years of college. I was pole vaulting for a D1 school and president of my fraternity.. I was still not confident in myself as a person. My identity was based on 'what I did' rather that 'who I was'. I had surgery to 'fix' my ears when I was 24 years old. Still, much of my mid 20s I was floating around, getting by with random jobs until I found training and realized I could coach, teach and motivate for a career. Thank God for that. Purpose. Sure my physical appearance had changed, and sure it probably helped in an industry largely based on aesthetics. But more importantly, I had found a purpose. Loosely defined at that point, but I knew I loved coaching and changing lives and now had an opportunity to do so through fitness.\nI don't share that part of my life very often, and I wish I did more.\nI am still working everyday not to fall back into old patterns, self doubt, lack of confidence, beating myself up over my insecurities. Work in progress.\nWhere ever you are right now is exactly where you are supposed to be. That doesn't mean you have to stay there. We all have the power with in us to transform- physically, mentally, spiritually.\nWe all have insecurities and imperfections. That's what makes us human. We have all gone through periods in our life that we wish would end sooner than later.\nWhatever you've been through in your life made you who you are today. And today you are f*cking awesome! Don't forget that.\n"}, {"date": "2015-03-11T11:33:11.000Z", "comments": 3, "tags": ["#SpeerStrength", "#SSL", "#Humpday", "#train", "#work", "#push", "#l4l", "#f4f", "#makeitcount", "#leanbody", "#makeitcount", "#protrainer", "#like4like", "#follow4follow", "#grow", "#fitfam", "#fitlife", "#nyc"], "likes": 105, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/b4646ea163e6f88a3ebc4b816a5280ea/5B587C11/t51.2885-15/e15/10990555_1551980335052611_839420286_n.jpg", "description": "It's amazing how far fitness can takes us.

Immobile ankles are also a major cause of hip and knee pain due to over compensation.\n\nHere is a nice 3 step series to prep the ankles.\n\n1) foot roll x 10 - mobilizing the foot / ankle in plantar flexion (pointing the toe) and inversion and eversion ( turning the foot in and out) is often over looked when mobilizing the ankle. You should feel a nice stretch from the top of your ankle down the side of your foot.\n\n2- Calve stretch x 20 sec - lengthening the musculature and soft tissue of the calf ( gastroc and soleus ) will allow for greater range in dorsi flexion. If you bend your knee slightly you will enhance the stretch in your soleus, the lower part of your calf.\n\n3 - knee push - keep your heel on the floor and push your knee towards the wall. At minimum your knee should be able to touch the wall with your toe 4 inches away from the wall.\n\nThis takes less than 1 minute per foot. I have all my clients so this everyday as part of their warm up.\n\nHave fun!!!\n\n"}, {"date": "2015-06-27T13:00:37.000Z", "comments": 0, "tags": ["#Repost"], "likes": 35, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/cd11de35166891c6d353ef9205fa25a2/5B70FBCB/t51.2885-15/e15/11376219_1635000356742771_1689842079_n.jpg", "description": ""}, {"date": "2015-01-09T13:51:49.000Z", "comments": 12, "tags": ["#theanarchyworkout", "#gymnastics", "#getresults", "#speerstrength", "#progressisperfection", "#f4f", "#like4like"], "likes": 169, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/5812c64ffef69b771458e4a50f44b77e/5B9C5315/t51.2885-15/e15/10903556_586828551417269_723403991_n.jpg", "description": "Good Morning!

We all have different perspectives and reactions to our environments. That\u2019s what makes you.. you! Don\u2019t trade your individuality for anything, you are you, embrace every little bit of you!\n\nBack to my point- It\u2019s about figuring out what works for you, implementing the actions into your life, sticking with them for long enough that they be come habits.\n\nThis is not an excuse to be lazy and say \u2018I don\u2019t really LIKE working out, I guess it\u2019s not for me\u2019...NO! Always strive to be the best version of you- you have to be honest with yourself about what that means. Some days are a struggle, some days you\u2019re walking on clouds, that\u2019s life- take the next step and keep moving forward.\n\nI\u2019m an introvert at heart, I need my alone time to recover, reflect and rest. My actions and creative processes are optimized when I am in a stimulating environment- meaning I watch, I listen, I bounce ideas, I talk things out, I move, I feel the energy around me and it amps me up. My workouts are always better when I train with someone or in a group- that\u2019s me, period. Yes, I will workout alone, and sometimes I use it as (mental) recovery and reflection time, but when I want to go hard I need a stimulating, engaging environment. Throw a competition in the mix and I\u2019m full throttle ahead.\n\nMy point is figure out how YOU best think, learn, train and recover- embrace it- make it work for you!\n\nDon\u2019t beat yourself up over not being the guy who trains at 330am, that sure as heck ain\u2019t me, that\u2019s ok. Find a workout partner, or an accountability group or an at home DVD series. Figure out what time of day you feel the best and has the least interruptions and arrange your schedule (as best you can within reality of your situation). The effort and financial resources you put in on the front end will eventually come back 10 fold in success because you\u2019ll actually be taking the action necessary to succeed, not half-assing things wishing you \u2018liked working out alone\u2019.

Along with the increase in running volume often comes increased tightness in calves, hamstrings and hips. Preparing your joints and muscles before you run can help keep you running strong and pain free.\nThis is an 8 move warm up circuit to prep your ankles and hips for your run.\n1) Ankle rolls - do 10 each direction, focus on feeling a stretch in the front and outside of the ankle.\n2) Calf Stretch - 20 seconds\n3) Dorsiflexion push - do 12, keep your heel on the floor and push your knee forward alternating between inside big toe, middle toe, outside pinky toe. ( Do all 1-3 right leg, then 1-3 left leg)\n4) Hamstring Stretch - hold 20seconds - keep hips squared and down foot pointing forward. Reach for for foot with the opposite hand.\n5) IT band Stretch - hold 20 seconds- This looks very similar to the hamstring stretch, with the opposite hand reach to the outside of your shin and lean forward slightly.\n6) Hip flexor Stretch - hold 20 seconds - Focus on firing you glutes on the back leg. Both the torso rotation and overhead reach are great options. If you plan to sprint or run hills this stretch is very important, both before and after you run.\n7) Lateral leg swings - do 10 each leg -Swings should feel light and loose, not forced. Range of motion with increase through out the set. Keep hips squared and your down foot flat and pointing forward. ( My foot is shifting more that I'd like in the video) You will get some added ankle mobility in the transverse plane by keeping your foot forward and still.\n8) Forward / Backward leg swings - do 10 each leg - Focus on keeping your torso tall and abs tight. Don't bend forward or arch your back. This gives you true range though the hips and engages truck stability in a similar fashion to running.\nThis circuit will take about 5 minutes - your run will thank you for it!\nHave fun and have and awesome day!!!"}, {"date": "2015-10-11T15:05:32.000Z", "comments": 6, "tags": ["#SpeerStrength", "#SSL", "#SundaySeries", "#fitfam", "#leanpower", "#nyc", "#soho", "#fitlife", "#trainright", "#trainsmart", "#l4l", "#f4f", "#fb", "#liveright"], "likes": 179, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/dcdc009dd0b6800bc132ee4f257df797/5ADCFE14/t51.2885-15/e15/10852599_147803158905518_331165928_n.jpg", "description": "Another full body exercise for you'all to incorporate this week and get those lower backs strengthened up.

Think about pulling the DBs back towards your hips as you jump by creating tension with you upper back, lats and triceps. This will hold your torso in better position and work postural muscles in your upper back. * Abs - Control the motion in both direction. Keep you lower back pressed against the floor, especially as you bring arms over head. Lower your arms and legs only as far as you can with your low back on the floor. * Squeeze abs and glutes in the plyo push ups * Modifications - use only body weight, air squats instead of jumps, regular push ups instead of plyo.\nI used 25lb DBs and got 10-1 in 8:58 min.\nHave fun with this and have an awesome day!\n"}, {"date": "2016-12-08T15:14:07.000Z", "comments": 12, "tags": ["#tbt", "#staydriven", "#performixdriven", "#badassteam", "#passion", "#purpose", "#inspire", "#riseup"], "likes": 506, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/36ff94cc58d53170424475cec8d3fadb/5B5FBC53/t51.2885-15/e35/15275629_1347610218596018_4578694291567673344_n.jpg", "description": ""}, {"date": "2015-02-05T12:26:47.000Z", "comments": 2, "tags": ["#tbt", "#grateful", "#getright", "#vitaminD", "#l4l", "#f4f", "#fb", "#travel", "#sunshine", "#summerweather", "#instagood", "#photooftheday"], "likes": 168, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/836861bf773f63a1d13e968ea3da56ba/5B5B04FA/t51.2885-15/e15/10950551_1382676718709425_710989650_n.jpg", "description": "Throwing it back to a sunny day in Anguilla!

Here are 2 workouts using a 2KB clean and front squat with a pull up.\nMETABOLIC EMOM\nClean and Squat / Jump to Pull Up (First and second video)\n\nEMOMs can deliver a serious metabolic hit. This workout is no different. It's a gasser.. your arms, legs and grip will also be challenged. Start with a light to medium bell.\nProgram Rx\nMinute 1 - clean and squat x 5\nMinute 2 - Jumping Pull up x 5 (Rest is the time remaining in each minute)\n\nRepeat for 20 min \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffbOn the jumping pull ups, continue the pull up from the point which you catch the bar, don't fall back into a dead hang and then pull. You can set up a box or step to jump from. \ud83e\udd15For safety, when jumping from a box, make it high enough that you are holding onto the bar when you jump. Don't let the bar go for the entire 5 reps.\n\nSTRENGTH LADDER\nClean and Squat / Strict Pull Up (Third video)\nProgram Rx\nKB clean and squat x 1\nStrict pull up x 1\nKB clean and squat x 2\nStrict pull up x 2\n... work up to 5\nRest only as needed between rungs.\nRest 1-2 min between ladders. \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffb Ladders are an awesome way to build strength on the foundation of technique. Starting with lower reps allows you the 'grease the groove' of the movement. Focus of strict technique, especially in the first tree rings when you are fresh. This will carry over into the longer sets. Use a heavier bell than the EMOM set. \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffb Use a band or assisted pull up if needed.\nDo each workout once a week for 3 weeks. Take 2-3 days between each. Strength, cardio and physique improvements coming your way!\nHave fun and have an awesome night!"}, {"date": "2015-01-09T14:04:33.000Z", "comments": 4, "tags": ["#theanarchyworkout", "#stronger", "#getresults", "#workoutdvd", "#fitness", "#menshealth", "#speerstrength", "#follow4follow", "#like4like"], "likes": 49, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/7189431b94cdb48949e0fd52278ce746/5B9C4E56/t51.2885-15/e15/10852643_408319189325074_2125478013_n.jpg", "description": "New Year.
