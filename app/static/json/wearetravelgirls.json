Originally being a beautiful garden given as a wedding gift to a Moroccan prince, it was remade into a hotel almost a century ago and has been declared as one of the most beautiful places in the world by, amongst others, Winston Churchill. Make sure to dress appropriately upon arrival and take your time exploring all the beauty that this place has to offer; from the garden of arrival to the different squares and rooms throughout. Finish up in the main garden going for a stroll and grabbing a coffee or some lovely Moroccan food for lunch.\u2800\n\u2800\n\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2800\n\u2800\nTo make our community an informative and educational place for our female followers, we now select photos from submissions including detailed traveller tips and advice on the destination. \u2800\n\u2800\nSubmit your photos and travel tips for a feature on our Instagram on WeAreTravelGirls.com/Photo-Submission/ \u2800\n\u2800\n\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2800\n\u2800\n", "date": "2018-03-28T06:20:09.000Z", "likes": 10050, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/66604ee02f46caea1cb29347cc075db5/5B6B46C5/t51.2885-15/e35/29401542_406827733112795_4744139197768531968_n.jpg"}, {"tags": ["#wearetravelgirls", "#watgfridayfavorites", "#bali", "#northbali", "#thebalibible", "#wonderfulindonesia", "#indonesia", "#beautifuldestinations", "#beautifulmatters"], "comments": 25, "description": "We Are Travel Girls Friday Favourites // Every Friday Founders @beckyvandijk and @vanessarivers share some of our favourite travel destinations, activities, travel products and travel tips with you!\n______\n\nThis weeks Friday Favourite is North Bali!

It\u2019s nicknamed the \u201cBlue City\u201d because historically homes were painted blue to signify that a Brahmin (Hindu priest) lived there.

And who can blame me \u2014 they are the only remaining Ancient Wonder of the World built over 4,000 years ago! \u2800\n\u2800\nI have put off visiting Egypt for the last five years because everyone told me it \u2018wasn\u2019t safe\u2019 to go there alone. I ended up going alone anyway, because I knew that if I didn\u2019t, then I\u2019d probably never end up going. I received a number of mixed reactions when I told people I was going there solo. Most of them believed I was digging my own grave. If you appreciate history, culture and great energy, then you will find the city of Cairo to be very beautiful. I found the local people to be very caring and friendly. My tour guide Samir treated me like I was his daughter and made me feel at home. \u2800\n\u2800\nThe pyramids are very easily accessible however I strongly recommend hiring a private tour guide, it\u2019ll make everything so much easier. At no point in my trip did I feel unsafe. That being said, you should always take precautions wherever you go. I stayed at Mena House Hotel. It is located right next to the pyramids (you have stunning views of the pyramids from the hotel) and the grounds feature beautiful outdoor pools and gardens. The staff were wonderful, I highly recommend staying here.\u2800\n\u2800\n\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2800\n\u2800\nTo make our community an informative and educational place for our female followers, we now select photos from submissions including detailed traveller tips and advice on the destination. \u2800\n\u2800\nSubmit your photos and travel tips for a feature on our Instagram on WeAreTravelGirls.com/Photo-Submission/ \u2800\n\u2800\n\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2800\n\u2800\n", "date": "2018-01-05T11:12:41.000Z", "likes": 9219, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/a3131c0faad131e46787adcbec4baf23/5B66804D/t51.2885-15/e35/25023645_1988140494742448_7130831654909640704_n.jpg"}, {"tags": ["#wearetravelgirls", "#watg", "#watgindia", "#india", "#jaipur", "#thepinkcity", "#travelwomen", "#travelgirls", "#exploretheworld", "#globalgirl", "#globetrotter", "#travel", "#traveltheworld", "#letsgosomewhere", "#doyoutravel"], "comments": 25, "description": "JAIPUR // Jaipur may be known as the pink city, but it also has beautiful sand and gold coloured buildings to explore.

Hand-painted blue tiles decorate the mosque\u2019s interior walls, and at night the mosque comes alive when its bathed in blue as lights frame the mosque\u2019s five main domes, six minarets and eight secondary domes. \u2800\n\u2800\nThe mosque sits next to Hagia Sophia, making it easy to visit both sites together, but remember the mosque is used for worship so you will need to plan your visit around prayer times. Mid-morning is a great time to visit, but expect to queue as this is a popular tourist spot. \u2800\n______\u2800\n\u2800\nWe Are Travel Girls is a community created to inspire, connect, educate and empower female travellers.

However, after 20 days traveling in Pakistan, I can say it is one of my favorite countries in the world. Pakistan is the land of hospitality and you will find the kindest people you will ever meet.

Sadly, it destroyed the early settlements of what used to be a single island. Today, it seems to be the most popular island in Greece.

This temple is not on every tourist list for visitors to KL, meaning you will be able to visit this beautiful place of worship with few other other people around. \u2800\n\u2800\nThe temple is one of the oldest and largest in Asia built in 1894, and was dedicated to Tian Hou, a goddess said to protect fishermen. Set on a hill, the temple offers stunning views back out over the city - giving you a unique mix of the modern city married with a traditional buddhist temple. It's a beautiful place to visit both during the day and the night when it is all lit up and I highly recommend adding it to your schedule when you visit the city. \u2800\n\u2800\n\u2606 Note, I did not have the temple on my itinerary on the day that I went so was not wearing long trousers or skirt. However, the dress code at Thean Hou is relaxed, and tourists are permitted to visit in shorts. But I do advise always checking dress codes in advance and wearing respectful clothing\n______\u2800\n\u2800\nThe We Are Travel Girls community is a place we created to inspire, connect and educate female travellers and we are always looking for new ways to evolve, grow and move it in the right direction to meet that goal.

Still made for a great view to get close and enjoy the beautiful views. If you are able to visit Costa Rica, make sure to stop by this waterfall. It is a hike down, but so worth it.

However, with a 14 hour return journey, this is sometimes not feasible, especially if you are on a short trip! However, only 45 minutes away is the lesser known Agafay Desert. This Stone Desert features some beautiful camps which you can spend the day in or even an overnight trip. My top recommendation would be @scarabeocamp, which is visually stunning and the perfect way to relax after the hustle and bustle of the Marrakech Medina!\u2800\n\u2800\n\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2800\n\u2800\nTo make our community an informative and educational place for our female followers, we now also select photos from submissions including detailed traveller tips and advice on the destination. \u2800\n\u2800\nSubmit your photos and travel tips for a feature on our Instagram on WeAreTravelGirls.com/Photo-Submission/ \u2800\n\u2800\n\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2800\n\u2800\n", "date": "2018-04-10T12:26:26.000Z", "likes": 4105, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/908247d6dad05cb0c6332bd7b908f9d3/5B62442B/t51.2885-15/e35/30076631_158213478204927_1730576326538035200_n.jpg"}, {"tags": ["#travel", "#traveller", "#backpacker", "#globe", "#travelgirls", "#wanderlust", "#adventure", "#adventuregirls", "#explore", "#exploretheworld", "#travelblog", "#travelblogger", "#travelphotography", "#photography", "#justpassingthrough", "#instatravel", "#travelling", "#holiday", "#vacation", "#picoftheday", "#shetravels", "#exploremycity", "#jetsetter", "#globelletravels", "#sheisnotlost", "#christmas", "#santa", "#festive", "#bolivia", "#salardeuyani"], "comments": 16, "description": "It's still Christmas right?! \ud83c\udf85\ud83c\udffd\ud83c\udf85\ud83c\udffd\ud83c\udf85\ud83c\udffd Loving Alyssa @mylifesatravelmovie pics from Bolivia.

Link in our bio.\n______\nWe Are Travel Girls was created 18 months ago by @beckyvandijk and @vanessarivers. When we started we simply wanted to provide a platform to promote other women and share their travel stories on WeAreTravelGirls.com. But as we grew our ideas, the community grew with us and WATG has become so much more than our original vision. With a huge amount of hard work (don't believe the photos we post, we spend 95% of our time behind a laptop screen!) and your support we have created a company that now inspires your travel on Instagram, connects you in our Facebook group, brings women together offline at meet-ups, publishes 5 travel stories per week from members of the community and has recently launched @travelgirlsgetaways where we can travel together!\nThank you to everyone who supports this community and helps it to grow everyday. We really appreciate you all and hope you enjoy the full video shot by talented videographer Iris @crafted_films \ud83c\udfa5\nBecky & Vanessa \ud83d\ude18\n______\nAs founders we continue to think bigger and are always looking for feedback on what we are doing and what we can do better to build a community that YOU love! Make sure you are up to date with everything we are doing and how you can get involved by subscribing to our email list. Here we share travel inspiration from women in the community, information about our events and trips and also will soon be sharing opportunities to be an ambassador for WATG to attend events and press trips with us!\n______\n", "date": "2017-09-14T06:14:56.000Z", "likes": 7737, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/ebba5a496246107efecaa4485986e37b/5AE30FD0/t51.2885-15/e15/21568592_120309015271854_6660328536072519680_n.jpg"}, {"tags": ["#wearetravelgirls", "#watgmorocco", "#watgmarrakech", "#morocco", "#marrakech", "#watgtrips", "#travelwithus", "#letsgo", "#beautifuldestinations", "#beautifulmatters", "#wanderlust", "#wanderwithus"], "comments": 25, "description": "MARRAKECH // Have you explored the souks of Marrakech?

Kenny started his hawaiian shirt company since he couldn't find cool shirts for himself and has branched out to cute mini-wraps for girls! (probably due to the fact girls kept pinching the shirts to wear over their bikinis - which is also a super cute look!)\u2800\n\u2800\nKenny kindly gifted each girl on our recent Bali retreats one of these wraps and they looked great teamed with a bikini and a coconut.

I still have another week to explore and know it won\u2019t be enough so I cannot wait to come back - and we want you to come here with us! \u2800\u2800\n\u2800\u2800\nYou can express interest in joining us in Sri Lanka or another destination or book your place on our Bali Retreats in October and our Malawi Safari & Charity Trip in September.

The amazing view at the top most point (ca. 3200 meters), which you can reach with gondola 3, is just breathtaking. But a lot of people don't know anything about the natural ice palace up at the top. Its an incredible glacier that you are able to go inside and explore to see amazing ice formations. Also, if you want to do something unique ask about stand up paddling in the glacier lake that formed on the inside. It\u2019s an incredible experience. I can really recommend it. Ask for Paul as a guide, he was so helpful and knows everything about the glacier.\u2800\n\u2800\n\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2800\n\u2800\nTo make our community an informative and educational place for our female followers, we now also select photos from submissions including detailed traveller tips and advice on the destination. \u2800\n\u2800\nSubmit your photos and travel tips for a feature on our Instagram on WeAreTravelGirls.com/Photo-Submission/ \u2800\n\u2800\n\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2800\n\u2800\n", "date": "2018-02-28T01:47:47.000Z", "likes": 4110, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/e84a739cc07ce900e0bfe66d4a441b47/5B95699A/t51.2885-15/e35/28151303_159655098026754_4314275003651588096_n.jpg"}, {"tags": [], "comments": 25, "description": "Next up on our contributor list is professional travel photographer Lisa @the_wanderinglens\nI am so excited that Lisa is part of the first group of We Are Travel Girls contributors as her page is one of my personal favourites, showcasing dreamy landscapes and cool over / underwater photography making me wish I was a better photographer!

While the building looks Romanesque from the outside, its interiors are adorned with Gothic cloisters and Baroque ceramic tiles (azulejos) that beautifully illustrate Portuguese history, culture, and religion. In front of this cathedral, there\u2019s a large square that not only offers gorgeous views over the city, but also connects to some lovely narrow alleys that eventually lead you to the Ribeira. There, you can find numerous restaurants and cafes with magical views of the Douro River and the pretty little houses that surround it. If you do plan to visit Porto, make sure to also check out Aveiro, an intriguingly colourful seaside town that\u2019s only an hour away.\u2800\n\u2800\n\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2800\n\u2800\nTo make our community an informative and educational place for our female followers, we now also select photos from submissions including detailed traveller tips and advice on the destination. \u2800\n\u2800\nSubmit your photos and travel tips for a feature on our Instagram on WeAreTravelGirls.com/Photo-Submission/ \u2800\n\u2800\n\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2800\n\u2800\n", "date": "2018-03-10T01:05:03.000Z", "likes": 6413, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/d8076fa1ad779c64432eaa4b200efb42/5B66BA8A/t51.2885-15/e35/28765360_1986984628289410_9209254165820211200_n.jpg"}, {"tags": [], "comments": 23, "description": "When you call for an Uber on the beach.

However i\u2019ve been visiting since I was a child as my mother\u2019s family are from here, so much so that it\u2019s become a second home. As such I\u2019ve discovered how much soul this small but buzzy town has, from the bold multi-coloured houses that line the streets to the lively children keen to have a chat and test their English. It also has architecture to rival the sights of the North, with the breathtaking Meenakshi Temple presiding over the town (historically no one was allowed to build any building taller than the temple towers), as well as the beautiful 17th century Thirumalai Nayak Palace. Whilst South India might not be the most obvious travel destination, it definitely has a few hidden gems worth making the trip!\u2800\u2800\n\u2800\u2800\n\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2800\u2800\n\u2800\u2800\nTo make our community an informative and educational place for our female followers, we now also select photos from submissions including detailed traveller tips and advice on the destination. \u2800\u2800\n\u2800\u2800\nSubmit your photos and travel tips for a feature on our Instagram on WeAreTravelGirls.com/Photo-Submission/ \u2800\u2800\n\u2800\u2800\n\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2800\u2800\n\u2800\u2800\n", "date": "2018-02-25T05:31:04.000Z", "likes": 4586, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/48e7e37c4a5d2c82b5140d622facce9c/5B9A47B2/t51.2885-15/e35/27892465_1760851727301140_7917963031277993984_n.jpg"}, {"tags": ["#wearetravelgirls", "#travelgirls", "#travelblogger", "#travelcommunity", "#girlboss", "#femaletravel", "#femaletraveller", "#traveltheworld", "#womenintravel", "#japan", "#japantravel", "#beautifulmatters", "#kyoto", "#fushiniinari", "#kaptenandson", "#kaptenandfriends"], "comments": 25, "description": "FUSHIMI INARI SHRINE, KYOTO // Our WATG founder Becky @beckyvandijk enjoying the famous Fushimi Inari shrine on our recent @travelgirlsgetaways trip to Japan\u2800\u2800\n\u2800\u2800\n\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\n\u2800\u2800\nTraveller Tip From Becky \u21a0 There is just one main tip needed for visiting Fushimi Inari Shrine and that is to arrive early! We woke up before sunrise and made sure that we were at the shrine before 6am when the sunrises. Check the exact sunrise time when you are visiting and make sure to plan accordingly. By getting there early you will be able to take some photos without other tourists in them and enjoy exploring the complex without a tonne of people around. Make sure to go beyond the first gates and keep walking to find more trails of tori gates and plenty of opportunities to capture some wonderful shots. \u2800\u2800\nWearing sunglasses by @kaptenandson\u2800\u2800\n\u2800\u2800\n\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\n\u2800\u2800\nTo make our community an informative and educational place for our female followers, we now select photos from submissions including detailed traveller tips and advice on the destination. \u2800\u2800\n\u2800\u2800\nSubmit your photos and travel tips for a feature on our Instagram on WeAreTravelGirls.com/Photo-Submission/ \u2800\u2800\n\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\n\u2800\u2800\n", "date": "2017-12-31T10:04:21.000Z", "likes": 4181, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/863fcbe1286f9a92953e0623ce24f214/5B5DFD58/t51.2885-15/e35/25023756_1786654174739950_720130212968267776_n.jpg"}, {"tags": ["#wearetravelgirls", "#thetravelwomen", "#globelletravels", "#sidewalkerdaily", "#darlingescapes", "#girlslovetravel", "#girlstravel", "#travelgirls", "#sheisnotlost", "#shewhowanders", "#ladiesgoneglobal", "#shetravels", "#travelgals", "#girlsjustwannatravel", "#travellushes", "#passionpassport", "#girlsborntotravel", "#worldofwanderlust", "#worldwanderlust", "#girlsdoloveoutdoors", "#jetsettingchicks", "#travelingladies", "#flygirlswhofly", "#peopleoftravel", "#lifewelltraveled", "#femmetravels", "#travelfemme", "#thetravelwomen", "#", "#girlgi", "#travelgirldiary"], "comments": 20, "description": "Good morning wanderlusters!

My baby girl has two passports (British and US) and has visited three countries at just six-months-old. It sounds cool to be a travel mom but in reality it is like being an unpaid sherpa. Gone are the days when you can throw a few things in an overnight bag and just go somewhere (at least when traveling with your family). \u2800\n\u2800\nFamily travel, especially with a baby, requires planning.

I was six. In this book, R. Leakey takes his readers on a journey through the lands of Africa. Intrigued by the human-like skull and the Serengeti plains on the cover, I insisted my father purchase it from the local thrift store. It is still signed by a George who owned the book decades before. It was at this time that my fascination of Africa began. In May I will graduate with my BA in Anthropology. Amazingly my childhood fascination withstood the test of time and is as intense in my adulthood as it was then. To explore the lands I found so novel in this book would make real for me a very intimate, special passion; a passion to bring to life these lands of antiquity through photography and storytelling. Years of exposure to National Geographic photos, documentaries, expeditions, and four years of intense study have only amplified my dreams of exploring Tanzania. I am ready to live, breathe, and share this adventure.''", "date": "2016-05-03T21:08:42.000Z", "likes": 1644, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/8266304e9ecf16b4282846de8b8cc77b/5B61DAEB/t51.2885-15/e35/21149510_108027643269325_569117376134512640_n.jpg"}, {"tags": [], "comments": 25, "description": "We Are Travel Girls favourite @mahakemala taking pictures at the beautiful rice terraces in Ubud, Bali.

The Palace combines gothic and Indian influences as well as Moorish suggestions together with exotic and plant motifs which are harmoniously extended to the exterior. The gardens have received species from all corners of the world, which were planted according to their geographical origin.

The city is filled with many lovers of poets, dramatists, and painters. If you are a coffee lover like me, you will enjoy the cafes that are located in every corner!

This is the most colorful town I\u2019ve ever seen, possibly in the whole world. This wasn\u2019t just a row of homes, the whole neighborhood was painted a vibrant color. Every home. Every color. It was a weird journey getting to Burano. I\u2019d only had 2 hours of sleep on a bus the night before. I landed in Florence at nearly midnight then took a bus to Venice. I needed to be at the bus stop at a certain time & only taxis were available so I was overcharged $40 for a 20 min ride. I made it to the bus stop & another girl asked me a question. I\u2019d already identified that we\u2019d stick together if anything went down. I didn\u2019t realize that this bus wasn\u2019t direct, so we had a stop at about 2am-5am. \u2800\n\u2800\nWe sat at a sketchy bus stop with our bags before our second bus came. She didn\u2019t speak much English, but I was happy to still be together. We arrived in town at a foggy 6am & had to walk around for an hour with our bags before storing them at a hostel for the day. We decided to spend the day together since we were both solo. \u2800\n\u2800\nFirst we stopped at a cafe to grab coffee, then wandered through the canals of Venice. We both wanted to go to Burano, so we bought a ticket and arrived midday to explore the colorful town. At the end of the day, when @merveeuls (the girl I\ufe0f met! She\u2019s Turkish) said \u201cI\u2019m really glad I met you\u201d, my heart melted! I told her I was really glad to meet her & spend the day with her too! How's that for girls sticking together around the world!? I\u2019ve had some of the best experiences with other solo female travelers I\u2019ve met around the world! I\ufe0f get a lot of messages from you about being nervous about solo travel, but there are quite a few of us out there & I\u2019m sure we can all agree that somehow things just come together!\u2800\n______\u2800\n\u2800\nSubmit your photos and travel tips for a feature on our Instagram on WeAreTravelGirls.com/Photo-Submission\n\n______\n\n", "date": "2017-12-13T10:41:18.000Z", "likes": 6826, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/bbc55d6260c6516f1e67eb9eb14ed9e5/5B5FEDA9/t51.2885-15/e35/25005087_845935075578613_3906812933748817920_n.jpg"}, {"tags": ["#wonderfulplaces", "#lonelyplanet", "#yourtravelpics", "#spottly", "#travelingtheworldd", "#worldtourists", "#peopleoftravel", "#wearetravelgirls", "#travelchannel", "#tourtheplanet", "#travelstoke", "#weliketotravel", "#heavenonearth", "#thedailyexplorer", "#earthgallery", "#nakedplanet", "#awesomeearth", "#wonderfulplaces", "#regalstreet", "#worlderlust", "#backpacking", "#bucketlist", "#holiday", "#vacation", "#travelingishappiness", "#epicexperiences", "#triplookers", "#beautifuldestinations", "#theworldsnapped"], "comments": 21, "description": "Exactly where we want to be on a Friday!

Instead of following the tourists as you leave the underground, get your Google map out and head in the opposite direction to Hillgate Place and Farm Place where you will find a lot more of these colourful houses and be able to explore the area without any crowds.

The tricky part is, there aren't many big landmarks to go off of, so you kind of have to navigate and stumble upon places on your own -- although asking a local always helps. This spot in Chefchaouen adorned with colorful flower pots is probably one of the most popular photo spots in the blue-washed town, which is why when we were here mid-day there were large tour groups strolling through all stopping for photos. To avoid this chaos, definitely wake up on the earlier side! It's hard to say exactly where this spot is, but it's off a pretty heavily trafficked cobblestone walk street up the hill from the main medina -- if you search hard enough, you're sure to find it!\u2800\n\u2800\n\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2800\n\u2800\nTo make our community an informative and educational place for our female followers, we now also select photos from submissions including detailed traveller tips and advice on the destination. \u2800\n\u2800\nSubmit your photos and travel tips for a feature on our Instagram on WeAreTravelGirls.com/Photo-Submission/ \u2800\n\u2800\n\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2800\n\u2800\n", "date": "2018-03-14T19:26:56.000Z", "likes": 7404, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/5bb2590437d1dbb5bfd50d955a243864/5B69954A/t51.2885-15/e35/29090803_1910796208990963_4734389845344911360_n.jpg"}, {"tags": ["#travel", "#traveller", "#backpacker", "#globe", "#travelgirls", "#wanderlust", "#adventure", "#adventuregirls", "#explore", "#exploretheworld", "#travelblog", "#travelblogger", "#travelphotography", "#photography", "#justpassingthrough", "#instatravel", "#travelling", "#holiday", "#vacation", "#picoftheday", "#sheroams", "#shetravels", "#exploremycity", "#jetsetter", "#dametraveler", "#globelletravels", "#sheisnotlost", "#travelgram", "#christmas"], "comments": 8, "description": "MERRY CHRISTMAS EVERYONE!! \ud83c\udf84\ud83c\udf89\u26c4\ufe0f\ud83c\udf81\ud83d\ude0d\u2764\ufe0f\u2744\ufe0f\ud83d\udcab I hope you are all celebrating with friends and family today. like @maudlecar .

I visited Kampot earlier this year and absolutely loved this lesser visited part of Cambodia. This shot was taken in Bokor National Park, a great day trip from Kampot where you can explore a derelict casino, Buddhist temples, old Catholic Churches, waterfalls and see some beautiful views as the clouds roll in!\nThe trip was my second time in Cambodia, my first was 14 years ago before there were thousands of people at Angkor Wat and Siem Reap, so I was excited to find an area with less crowds and highly recommend heading here if you visit Cambodia \ud83c\uddf0\ud83c\udded@beckyvandijk\n______\nThis community is a place we created to inspire, connect and educate female travellers and we are always looking for new ways to evolve, grow and move it in the right direction to meet that goal.

Its iconic, wavy canyon walls have been formed from millions of years of erosion, winds, and flooding, and have made it one of the most photographed slot canyons in the world. Visiting in the summer months will give you the sharp beams of sunlight, while winter months will be equally beautiful but with softer colors and lighting. Be sure to make a reservation well in advance for prime time of the day, because spots fill up quickly and the Canyon is only accessible by guided tour!\u2800\n\u2800\n\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2800\n\u2800\nTo make our community an informative and educational place for our female followers, we now also select photos from submissions including detailed traveller tips and advice on the destination. \u2800\n\u2800\nSubmit your photos and travel tips for a feature on our Instagram on WeAreTravelGirls.com/Photo-Submission/ \u2800\n\u2800\n\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2800\n\u2800\n", "date": "2018-02-23T06:35:00.000Z", "likes": 10592, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/904044fd5f732c82e1cfd2ccb1b86950/5B5B5011/t51.2885-15/e35/27880077_1943240932671396_1589378452048314368_n.jpg"}, {"tags": ["#travel", "#traveller", "#backpacker", "#globe", "#travelgirls", "#wanderlust", "#adventure", "#adventuregirls", "#explore", "#exploretheworld", "#travelblog", "#travelblogger", "#travelphotography", "#photography", "#justpassingthrough", "#easterisland"], "comments": 12, "description": "Are you this creative in your picture taking?!

Well it is, but there is more. Personally I am more into the \u2018typical\u2019 chaotic SouthEast Asian cities full of scooters, shouting street vendors and with amazing food stalls at every corner of the street, but then there is Little India. A surprisingly colourful and vibrant neighbourhood and -as you can imagine- my favourite part of town.

What most people don\u2019t know is that just 10-15 minute outside of town, there are a ton of natural hot springs that are heavenly to soak in! Whether you\u2019ve spent all day on the slopes during the winter season or hiking/backpacking during the summer season, these hot springs are a must! The best time of the day to be soaking in these hot springs are either early mornings before sunrise or early evenings just right before the sun sets. But really, there are no bad hours to be here. Some hot springs out here may require a 4x4 car with high clearance, but most are easy to get to. Not to mention, there are no bad views for any of these hot springs as they are surrounded by the views of the eastern sierra, which are beyond amazing.\u2800\n______\u2800\n\u2800\nTo make our community an informative and educational place for our female followers, we now select photos from submissions including detailed traveller tips and advice on the destination. \u2800\n\u2800\nSubmit your photos and travel tips for a feature on our Instagram on WeAreTravelGirls.com/Photo-Submission/ \u2800\n\u2800\n______\u2800\n\u2800\n", "date": "2017-12-21T17:39:26.000Z", "likes": 5575, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/dcfc4fffa90d37637027195f81573e9a/5B57AADB/t51.2885-15/e35/25017722_162931897797564_4927601826783559680_n.jpg"}, {"tags": [], "comments": 25, "description": "Anything boys can do, girls can do better!

Do you love to hike? If yes, Appenzellerland might be your heaven. This north-eastern Swiss region produces a nutty, bold cheese called Appenzeller K\u00e4se. To taste the best regional cheese, you need to hike into the mountains. For breathtaking scenery, hike to Seealpsee (a beautiful lake) in the Alpstein mountain range.

There are many picture perfect places to experience Bled, but three of them attract most of the visitors - pier with a statue in a shape of a heart overlooking magnificent lake and the island, the castle view up on the clif and the most majestic, Ojstrica hill view, where this picture was taken. But Bled is not popular only for its beauty, as it is the place where wished come true. The legend says that if you ring a bell in the Mary's church, your vish will come true.

It was my first time experiencing a whole new element. Was it worth it? Absolutely! The Glaciers are closed for the winter due to unpredictable weather. But for me a locked gate was an invitation.\nI don't recommend this hike to anyone without a guide. It was a thrilling yet terrifying experience. Each step felt like I was near death. I fell twice on black ice and ended up near a sinkhole. The snow was deceiving as it seemed like it was just snow later we realized we were standing on top of a thin layer of frozen river. You can hear the river roaring right underneath us. My heart was pounding, I was imagining the worse.\nAt this point my feet and hands were beyond frozen I was doubting my movement but we carefully made our way out of this situation and continued hiking towards the glaciers. The wind felt like tiny sharp knives stabbing our face at 100mph. We couldn't see 5 feet in front of us. We eventually made our way through the storm. Finally, we climbed the side of the glacier and entered through a small hole.\nI couldn't believe what I was standing in front of. It felt unreal. There was a moment where I felt no pain and just stood in awe. It was exactly what I had imagined it to be. I'm glad I get to live another day to tell this story, another day to explore this beautiful world. As exciting as this was never attempt to walk on the glaciers yourself. Several deaths have occurred from people falling through hidden crevices and sinkholes that are covered by thin layer of snow.''

This giraffe was particularly friendly and luckily I was able to get him to stand still enough to get this photo. Spending time at the giraffe manor is once of those experiences in life that is so magical that it's hard to describe and almost feels like a dream. Interacting with these beautiful animals is something that I have longed to do for a while now. It was the number one thing on my bucket list and I have no idea how I will ever be able to top this vacation. For those who want to plan a trip to the Giraffe Manor, I would recommend staying in the newer manor. If you stay there, you'll be able to feed the giraffes from your window in the morning.''

Perhaps you have heard of it, perhaps you have seen your favourite Instagrammer post about it, perhaps you even want to go yourself to get a perfect photo in front of a crowd of elephants. I was so disappointed to see yet another image appear in my feed glamourising Pinnawala I felt I had to say something. \u2800\nI had seen this place too before I went to Sri Lanka, but before I visit any destination I do my research and upon reading about the various places to see elephants, I discovered some disturbing truths about Pinnawala. What you don\u2019t see in the pretty pictures are the chains, the bull hooks, the elephant riding, the breeding for captivity and the various other tourist oriented activities here. I didn\u2019t see these for myself because I consciously did not want to visit and support this organisation. But you can read all about it on BornFree.org.uk where they advise tourists not to visit Pinnawala. \u2800\n\u2800\nAs a community with a large following, we have a responsibility to help educate others about travelling responsibly and ethically. Please do the same. Research places before you visit and if you see something you don\u2019t agree with please don\u2019t post a pretty picture anyway! And to the bloggers and Instagrammers with large followings, please think carefully about what you share and the impact your influence has when others travel somewhere specifically to recreate your images. \u2800\n\u2800\nI have been overwhelmed with the response we had to the stories and I appreciate everyone who has messaged or shared this on their own page to help spread this important message. We will continue to do our small part to help educate travellers, and if you want to read more about responsible tourism then please visit WeAreTravelGirls.com or if you want to write for us about this topic we accept article submissions too! \u2800\n\u2800\nThis photo was taken in Yala National Park, and you can also see elephants in the wild in many other parks in Sri Lanka or at the Elephant Transit Home.\u2800\n\u2800\nTogether we can use our platforms to help educate each other to travel in ethical and responsible ways!\u2800\n\u2800\nTHANK YOU!

We want to transport to this winter wonderland right away. \u2800\n______\u2800\n\u2800\nTraveller Tip From Asheley \u21a0 The best view of the day from Lake Moraine is sunrise, but know you aren't alone in this plan for Banff. A plethora of professional and novice photographers alike claim their ground hours before sunrise to catch this magical moment when the sun caps the tops of the mountains that surround Lake Moraine. If you're determined to make it there for sunrise, get out early, bring warm clothes, and pick your spot to watch the magic unfold. When you leave, take the roads as slow as you're able - there's some awesome view points that have places to pull off the road and take in some beautiful, lesser known views of Banff.\u2800\n______\u2800\n\u2800\nTo make our community an informative and educational place for our female followers, we now select photos from submissions including detailed traveller tips and advice on the destination. \u2800\n\u2800\nSubmit your photos and travel tips for a feature on our Instagram on WeAreTravelGirls.com/Photo-Submission/ \u2800\n______\u2800\n\u2800\n", "date": "2017-12-30T09:35:00.000Z", "likes": 9299, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/dd2b49dec7516db6dfa018e7996b93f0/5B6A4224/t51.2885-15/e35/25017334_1999673580314494_2020989194616176640_n.jpg"}, {"tags": ["#wearetravelgirls", "#travelgirls", "#travel", "#traveller", "#wanderlust", "#bucketlist", "#letsgo", "#letsinspireeachother", "#srilanka"], "comments": 4, "description": "Goodnight travel lovers..

Make sure you take the CTM bus -it costs 75 dirhams each way (roughly \u00a35) and the busses are quite new! If you can, spend more than just one day in Chaouen, there\u2019s plenty to see! Don\u2019t miss watching the sunset from the Spanish Mosque, it\u2019s a 20 minute climb up the mountain path, but when the blue town lights up with the orange tinge of the sky and the call to prayer comes on, it\u2019s pure magic!\u2800\n\u2800\n\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2800\n\u2800\nTo make our community an informative and educational place for our female followers, we now also select photos from submissions including detailed traveller tips and advice on the destination. \u2800\n\u2800\nSubmit your photos and travel tips for a feature on our Instagram on WeAreTravelGirls.com/Photo-Submission/ \u2800\n\u2800\n\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2727\u2800\n\u2800\n", "date": "2018-02-28T11:19:25.000Z", "likes": 4035, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/46cd1eaa1f878a58c183450b02cb8230/5B9900DD/t51.2885-15/e35/28432677_101247394043155_4714182535318339584_n.jpg"}, {"tags": ["#wearetravelgirls", "#travelgirls", "#travel", "#traveller", "#wanderlust", "#bucketlist", "#letsgo", "#adventure", "#world", "#newyork", "#streetart", "#westvillage"], "comments": 12, "description": "We \u2764\ufe0f this picture from @theclassycloud in the East Village.
