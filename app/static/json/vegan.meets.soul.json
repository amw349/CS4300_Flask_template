I was on a liquid/low calorie diet 80-90% of the time basically starved myself just to look perfect on my wedding day. I gained that back plus more. I thank God I now take the time to educate myself. This morning I have a mixture of black beans, corn, & lettuce. Nothing fancy, but these complex carbs keep me full longer & my body is working harder to digest these foods. Which means I have a higher metabolism & my body is in fat burning mode. I don't eat less anymore, I don't count calories, I simply portion control what I eat. Rather you are vegan, low carb, paleo, or whatever. The key to true weight loss is portion control, drink plenty of water, get lots of rest, exercise, & most of all enjoy life!
