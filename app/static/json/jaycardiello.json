Unlike, many processed or made with fruit products that have sugar added in. Plus, fruit contains a host of nutrients as well as fiber, which helps slow your absorption of fructose, the main sugar in most fruits.

Yes, this is TRUE! Bananas peels are 'loaded' with antioxidants, minerals, and vitamins, which make them the perfect natural cure for cell regeneration and ailments. For Splinters: Simply, cut out a small piece of the banana peel and wrap it over the area of your body (such as your finger) that has the splinter. You can use a piece of tape to hold the piece of banana peel on the skin. The banana's enzymes go to work immediately helping to dislodge the splinter and begin the healing process.

You may never hear these words spoken in the gym. But, for many those words should be part of their workout vocabulary. With 111 Days till Summer, many guys will be working the Preacher Curl into the workout arsenal in an attempt to 'Pump' up their biceps. However, in hopes of getting Popeye popping bi-ceps they will overload the Ez-Bar achieving nothing more than bad form resulting in shoulder, forearm and lower back pain. Reason: In an attempt bulk-up, guys overload the bar with too much weight causing their shoulders to round over the pad, while their hips rise off of the seat. Instead, aim for 'Form' and go 'Light'. Start by adjusting the height of the seat such that your arm-pits rest near the top of the pad with your upper arms are placed in front of your upper body. Keep feet flat on the floor and avoid swinging or rounding your back at anytime throughout the lift.
