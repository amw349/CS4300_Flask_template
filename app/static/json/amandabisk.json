A lot of running pain, joint wear & tear, and chronic injury can be prevented by keeping on top of your shoe game \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4c\nHere's how\ud83d\udc47\n\u25aa\ufe0fEvery person is different, try every shoe you can & even have a jog in the store (check your stride to see if your ankle/knees roll in when you run, get a feel for the shoe etc etc)\n\u25aa\ufe0fWhen those niggles & injuries start appearing it might be time to change shoes. Support & absorption decreases the more you run. If you run every day, you may need new shoes after 3/4 months (I use my older shoes for strength workouts/walks etc)\n\u25aa\ufe0fHaving 2 pairs & alternating them can increase the life of your shoes (the day or two rest in between lets the foam decompress & bounce back)\n\u25aa\ufe0fDon't put your shoes in the washing machine! It damages the foam & structure\n\u25aa\ufe0fTest your new shoes on a less demanding run (like today I only did 6x 200m medium paced runs with some core exercises in between). You can use this to see how your body pulls up after your run\n\nGood shoes are expensive\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\ude29 But looking after your body & preventing injuries (& the cost of physios, strapping tape, doctors etc) is definitely worth it in the long run (no pun intended \ud83d\ude1c).

Studying the human body and how exercise and food integrates with it is HARD. It takes so much time, effort, and experience to get even a simple understanding of how your body works and how to look after it, let alone how to look after someone else's!\nI know this because I have spent numerous years (over 8years now!) at college and university becoming qualified in the science of exercise and exercise physiology, and more recently specially qualified in coaching elite athletes, CrossFit, and yoga. I can tell you it is not an easy ride, nor does the learning ever stop.\nI strive to continue to learn and educate myself in this area because I want to be a knowledgeable voice for others. And I know there are so many others like me who have given up many years to be specialists in what they do.\nWhat I want you to get out of this is to know where your information is coming from. Your body is precious, and at the same time so very different than anyone else's...there are many amazing professionals who are dedicated to giving you the best possible information they can from years of learning and experience.

Think about how you're doing it, what muscles you should be activating, and most importantly enjoy trying to make every rep the best you can..because mastering the basics, is what helps you achieve all the bigger, bolder things you've got your eyes on! \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc\nab\u2764\ufe0fx\nClick the link in my bio for 7days of FREE workouts!! \ud83d\ude04\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc\ud83c\udf89 ", "tags": ["#freshbodyfitmind"]}, {"date": "2016-05-28T17:12:36.000Z", "likes": 12967, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/bb00f3b61d4cf05fae054680f2a28b06/5B56DF20/t51.2885-15/e35/20184631_1938578379764567_171779390256971776_n.jpg", "comments": 25, "description": "Finishing the day with a sunset ", "tags": ["#freshbodyfitmind", "#epic", "#freshbodyfitmind"]}, {"date": "2015-02-03T14:02:36.000Z", "likes": 5031, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/0b93711a71c326fb0a35390ec44df33e/5B5BE4AA/t51.2885-15/e15/20633288_666761840197548_7988880801125105664_n.jpg", "comments": 25, "description": "\ud83d\udc4a SQUAT You Way to Great Pins & a Perky Bum\n\nMy latest blog post is now live for you to check out on www.amandabisk.com! \ud83d\ude03 Click the link in my bio \ud83d\udc46\ud83d\udc46\ud83d\udc46to get my perfect squat tips & video!! \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udfa5 ", "tags": ["#abblog", "#fitness", "#squat", "#legs", "#booty", "#abbodysquad"]}, {"date": "2014-08-24T03:51:34.000Z", "likes": 2826, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/b8faf49f68bcb02db4313ad2eff0b47c/5B7248DD/t51.2885-15/e15/20482052_157855808123180_8346657456692133888_n.jpg", "comments": 17, "description": "Morning of running exercises and sprinting done and dusted \ud83d\udc5f\ud83d\udc4a Time for some lunch and Sunday afternoon chill time \ud83c\udf3e\ud83d\ude0c\ud83c\udf3e ", "tags": ["#givemefoodnow", "#starving"]}, {"date": "2016-05-27T08:14:53.000Z", "likes": 14631, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/aab4ee37afc7118e1afd895533db45c1/5B615FCA/t51.2885-15/e35/20482369_267070890463711_6121906818756116480_n.jpg", "comments": 25, "description": "The sun is out today! \ud83c\udf24 It's almost winter here in Australia so I'm soaking up every warm day I can! \ud83d\ude01 @_adamdunne and I took this pic on our walk! \ud83d\udc6b\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc\nI have a pretty funny boomerang from my morning workout at the park \ud83d\ude02 I'll share it with you later today!

Get a diary or notepad and schedule in your workouts for the week. You will be surprised at how much easier it is to 'find time' to workout if it's all planned out for you! \ud83d\udcd2\n2\ufe0f\u20e3\nFIND A BUDDY. Get your mum, friend, sister, parter, kids or even your dog involved in your active life. Even if you just go for a walk together, bike ride, play tennis, or find a local class to go to..it'll get you excited to workout and even catch up on some gossip (or have a one way chat if you're walking your dog! \ud83d\udc36\ud83d\ude09)!\n3\ufe0f\u20e3\nWORKOUT PASSION. Find something active you love to do. Just because you have been going to the gym for a year it doesn't mean you can't change it up once a week with a running group, martial arts class, power yoga, at home workout, or even a circus class! Give your body and mind some fresh exercise goodness and reignite that spark! \ud83c\udfd3\ud83d\udeb2\u26bd\ufe0f\u26f8\nab\u2764\ufe0fx\n", "tags": ["#freshbodyfitmind", "#hmsport"]}, {"date": "2016-05-02T07:08:03.000Z", "likes": 9985, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/0c3645a7b460fddbdae77971a5ca5182/5B6A950B/t51.2885-15/e35/20481914_104364743601878_8054227710626496512_n.jpg", "comments": 25, "description": "Yes. \ud83c\udf4e ", "tags": ["#freshbodyfitmind"]}, {"date": "2013-12-08T08:21:21.000Z", "likes": 917, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/d1c021f12ff581e4a6d429f59c7a3fb1/5B6DF06E/t51.2885-15/e15/20482530_260625344441880_5983808931401564160_n.jpg", "comments": 22, "description": "Time to ", "tags": ["#stopdropandyoga", "#yoga", "#challenge", "#love"]}, {"date": "2017-10-11T11:00:09.000Z", "likes": 12954, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/03bc88a98f7e6d845b14db02c9b0bcbc/5B5A8B97/t51.2885-15/e35/22344228_287043708465086_8305307654754926592_n.jpg", "comments": 25, "description": "My latest youtube vid is now live! \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc\ud83c\udfa5\ud83d\ude03 this one's a dreamy yoga flow for a better night's sleep \u2728\ud83d\ude34\u2728 give it a try and let me know if you sleep like a boss tonight! \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffcSee the link in my bio!

But you also have to realise that fruit as a whole food is packed full of fibre and other nutrients that balance out the amount of sugar. Fibre especially helps lessen 'sugar high' effects because it allows food to move effectively through the digestive tract, release sugar more slowly into the bloodstream, and also remove toxins from the body.\nFruit juice however, has had the fibre removed and this can spike your blood sugar (this is why I am not a huge juice drinker).\nSo my view? Fruit is natural, it's in its whole state, and has so many amazing health improving nutrients! I eat heaps of fruit, it has not made me ever put on weight, and it is a great snack (and even dessert) for my active lifestyle and when I feel like something sweet \u263a\ufe0f And it is definitely a better alternative to foods with processed white sugar! (Sweets, cakes, and even hidden sugar in packaged foods you might think are healthy!)\nOf course your diet is completely individual, so it is up to you to understand how you feel when you eat any type of food and know that it is ok to eat the way that best suits you! \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc ", "tags": ["#freshbodyfitmind"]}, {"date": "2015-09-19T02:38:20.000Z", "likes": 12991, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/a0a87276235728da81c42ad06cd8452e/5B76DC6F/t51.2885-15/e35/20478866_815923065234756_8239841057399898112_n.jpg", "comments": 25, "description": "Morning walk to my fave cafe along the west coast with @_adamdunne \u2600\ufe0f\ud83d\udc6b\u2615\ufe0f\nIt feel so good to take it a little easier today...My body is so sore after a full week of ", "tags": ["#freshbodyfitmind", "#Perth", "#westernaustralia"]}, {"date": "2014-01-28T06:23:58.000Z", "likes": 3294, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/ba5178dfd28ff4eb36b92d5b69d3c64d/5ADBAE58/t51.2885-15/e15/20479173_160227634546987_527896152633245696_n.jpg", "comments": 25, "description": "Stumbled across this little video while going through my laptop...training in Germany in 2010..seems like so long ago now! \ud83d\udc5f ", "tags": ["#polevault", "#trackandfield", "#athletics"]}, {"date": "2015-07-07T03:32:22.000Z", "likes": 11717, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/1e26e9e6968e53cca58ee4720972bdc1/5B528178/t51.2885-15/e35/20479279_734002880140305_4649481060617289728_n.jpg", "comments": 25, "description": "Just finished a morning walk/jog before the rain set in for the day!! \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udca6\ud83d\ude03 time for a stretch! \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc ", "tags": ["#winter", "#fitness", "#freshbodyfitmind", "#strongertogether"]}, {"date": "2016-05-20T09:27:06.000Z", "likes": 9070, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/e9b0a30972f13963d1742a6f17410eb5/5B76A332/t51.2885-15/e35/20481952_130873474188808_7219323026477678592_n.jpg", "comments": 25, "description": "Hey fam!!

(Even if that just means doing lots of planks and down dogs!)\n\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffc\nExercise 1 & 2 are a great way to start understanding what it's like to be upside down and to get your hands and wrists ready to be your base! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffc Its especially important to press your fingertips into the ground and spread your fingers wide. This will reduce pressure in your wrist joint \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\n\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffc\nThe 3 exercises on the wall (easiest - hardest) are a great way to help with you body position upside down. Always try to aim for a straight line from your hands up! and SQUEEZE EVERYTHING!! \ud83d\ude2c\n...\nIn all of these exercises think 'shoulders to ears', so almost like you are trying to create earmuffs with your arms...this will help to create a straighter body line \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc\nStick to the exercises you feel comfortable with and progress only when you've mastered the body shapes of each exercise \ud83d\ude0e\nNOTE: Use the video on your phone to check your technique!! \ud83d\ude09\ud83c\udfa5\nGood luck guys!

Keep your weight in your heels and squat down like you are sitting in a chair. This reduces pressure in the knee and activates your glutes\n\n2. Place your feet slightly wider than shoulder width apart and squeeze your knees OUT while squatting down & up. This activates more muscle groups (especially your biggest muscle, the glutes) & makes your squats stronger & more stable\n\n3. Keep your chest up & only go as far down as you can keep good technique.

If you have followed me for a while, you know I am all about taking small positive steps each day.

It doesn't need to be anything dramatic or overwhelming...just a few positive things to take you forward in the next 24hrs \u263a\ufe0f and make sure you take the time to review how your plan went and acknowledge your achievements at the end of the day...tick them off the list, say them out loud ('I achieved ........ today') , or tell someone what you achieved..anything to help celebrate your efforts!

Dad told me I wasn't the most flexible kid but I worked really hard and would even stretch and practise like crazy at home everyday before and after practise...by the time I was competing (at 6yrs old) I was pretty flexible and it was a strong aspect of my gymnastics (being tall and lanky I definitely wasn't powerful! \ud83d\ude1d)\nI competed until I was 18 and then I found my way into pole vault. As I tried to get stronger and began to do more weights and strength exercises (rather than stretching) I lost some of my flexibility. I can definitely say it is hard to be really strong and really flexible unless you train both a lot! After years of being a professional pole vaulter I eventually had to retire (due to chronic fatigue) and lost the ability to do any training at all.\nAfter almost a year of detraining and focusing solely on getting healthy I thought I would try yoga, simply because I wanted to move my body again and I thought it would be a good first step.\nTo cut a long story short, when I first stated yoga I had lost so much flexibility because I hadn't been moving my body, stretching or training for a long time. As time went on, I used yoga as a way to give myself new purpose and new goals. Not only did I aim to get more flexible to achieve all those awesome poses but I started to realise how it made me feel, physically and mentally.\nNow I do some form of yoga or stretching everyday, and yes, I have my flexibility back (yay!) but more importantly I FEEL amazing. Stretching is one of the best forms of rehab for your body and it is something we should ALL do regularly (of not everyday!)\nNo matter how old you are, what your body looks like, or how flexible you are right now every time you stretch you are helping your body. The more you do it, the better you will feel. Simple as that. AND yes you will get flexible!\nNo time invested in yourself is ever wasted \u2764\ufe0f\n", "tags": ["#stretch", "#yoga"]}, {"date": "2016-04-12T01:00:53.000Z", "likes": 11597, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/62a06adbd44f322963766107dbab3a5c/5B64355F/t51.2885-15/e35/20582749_253813271800368_7977245279453708288_n.jpg", "comments": 25, "description": "Hanging at the gym \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffc ", "tags": ["#musclebeach"]}, {"date": "2014-04-01T08:57:47.000Z", "likes": 4365, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/0ac305ab69c1c52315c39a5a983847ee/5B6637A3/t51.2885-15/e15/20589524_734357203415293_1877058385191370752_n.jpg", "comments": 25, "description": "Second day in a row of crossfit at @crossfitsydney \ud83d\udcaa the body is sore but loving every minute!!...time for a good stretch and relax \ud83d\ude0c\ud83c\udf19\u2728 ", "tags": ["#aimingforfivedaysinarow", "#fitness", "#challenge"]}, {"date": "2015-02-10T08:51:07.000Z", "likes": 7430, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/2c9e1ad77b94d2d4ec0e7225423f3dd5/5B5823C4/t51.2885-15/e15/20398864_475368742825156_7649584036918067200_n.jpg", "comments": 25, "description": "Ever wanted to join me for a yoga class?! \ud83d\ude4f\u263a\ufe0f Now you can!

Stretching releases hormones that encourage your body (and brain!) to relax, the dimmed light and minimal electrics calm your nervous system, and time to slow down and focus only on stretching your muscles will clear your mind and encourage restful sleep (the most essential time for repair and rejuvenation).\nI want you to try it. Even if your not overly stressed, you will still be amazed by how much this simple way to end your day will change the way you function entirely! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\u2728\nHappy stretching fam \ud83d\ude18\nab\u2764\ufe0fx\nwww.amandabisk.com/stretchguide \u2728", "tags": []}, {"date": "2016-08-11T00:50:58.000Z", "likes": 7277, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/cb41776790327787814ca06cf96842a4/5B6A9150/t51.2885-15/e35/16229375_227310861061640_7672344146656362496_n.jpg", "comments": 25, "description": "My fave \ud83d\ude0d ", "tags": ["#breakfast", "#freshbodyfitmind"]}, {"date": "2017-05-04T09:32:11.000Z", "likes": 16802, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/bb42907bb6f180e4bd3e3fc07de8c6e8/5B65D3DD/t51.2885-15/e35/18298663_715885415249169_2161790759588593664_n.jpg", "comments": 25, "description": "Leaving my little weenies behind for 9 days \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d @westcoast_weenies\n...But I know they'll be spoilt rotten with my mumma and my friend @mammu_liisu \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude18\nNext stop Bali with @_adamdunne! \u2600\ufe0f\ud83c\udf34 and an epic week at @activeescapes coaching my crew! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude01\nWe'll be sharing all the bts on my story so you guys can keep up with the action!! \ud83c\udfa5\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc ", "tags": ["#Bali", "#fitness"]}, {"date": "2017-03-20T00:50:16.000Z", "likes": 15920, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/5b309d36c1bb52220146ff690a429355/5B6EEA3B/t51.2885-15/e35/17333507_1788972171429338_172354585162153984_n.jpg", "comments": 25, "description": "Morning walks with the \ud83d\udc36\ud83d\udc36 @westcoast_weenies ...well I end up doing most of the walking!! \ud83d\ude44 ", "tags": ["#dachshundsofinstagram"]}, {"date": "2016-02-20T10:03:28.000Z", "likes": 9372, "img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/8b2d73b098da856633a9e4c29aaa3953/5B64032F/t51.2885-15/e35/20479030_1917419985193012_7154933864618524672_n.jpg", "comments": 25, "description": "Chin ups!! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude1d I think these are my absolute fave upper body exercise \ud83d\ude0d Mainly because I have weak back muscles (my shoulder blades wing out!) and they help heaps with my posture!\nSee, it's ok to love your weaknesses! \ud83d\ude0a It's what makes you, you.

Have a look at your running technique, stretch regularly, change your shoes regularly (at least every 6months), build good core strength (including deep core & glutes!) and incorporate good recovery sessions (yoga, beach, massage etc)! \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\nab\u2764\ufe0fx", "tags": []}], "prof_img": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/4ea6283e635575258dd829c2a807ec97/5B606FBA/t51.2885-19/s320x320/21909649_1267484510063852_1947500311316791296_n.jpg", "num_of_posts": 2579, "following": 389, "alias": "amandabisk"}
